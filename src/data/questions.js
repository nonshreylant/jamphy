    question: String.raw`
Light of wavelength \(632\,nm\) is passing through an optically active medium of thickness \(20\,cm\). The optical rotation exhibited by the medium is \(18^\circ\). Which of the following options correctly states the magnitude of the difference in refractive indices corresponding to the left and the right circularly polarized light?

      String.raw`\(3.62\times10^{-5}\)`,
      String.raw`\(6.32\times10^{-7}\)`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Optical rotation \(\theta = 18^\circ = \frac{\pi}{10}\) rad.

Thickness \(d = 20\) cm \(= 0.2\) m.

Wavelength \(\lambda = 632\) nm.

Using the formula for optical rotation:
\(\theta = \frac{\pi d}{\lambda}(n_L - n_R)\)

Rearranging for the difference in refractive indices:
\(n_L - n_R = \frac{\theta \lambda}{\pi d} = \frac{(\frac{\pi}{10}) \times 632 \times 10^{-9}}{\pi \times 0.2}\)

\(n_L - n_R = \frac{63.2 \times 10^{-9}}{0.2} = 316 \times 10^{-9} = 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\)`,

Consider the superposition of two electromagnetic waves with their electric field vectors given by \(\vec{E}_1(z,t)=\hat{i}A_1\cos(kz-\omega t)\) and \(\vec{E}_2(z,t)=\hat{j}A_2\sin(kz-\omega t+\phi)\), where \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) are the amplitudes, \(k\) is the wavenumber, \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, and \(\phi\) is the relative phase.

      String.raw`\(\phi=0\) and \(A_1=A_2\)`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The resultant electric field components are:
\(E_x = A_1 \cos(kz-\omega t)\)
\(E_y = A_2 \sin(kz-\omega t + \phi) = A_2 \cos(kz-\omega t + \phi - \frac{\pi}{2})\)

The phase difference between the \(y\) and \(x\) components is \(\Delta\theta = \phi - \frac{\pi}{2}\).

For an elliptically polarized wave with principal axes along \(\hat{i}\) and \(\hat{j}\), the phase difference must be an integer multiple of \(\pi\).

This implies \(\phi - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). If \(\phi = 0\), the phase difference is \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\), which results in the required ellipse.

Furthermore, for it to be an ellipse and not a circle, the amplitudes must not be equal, so \(A_1 \ne A_2\).`,

\(Y = \bar{A}\bar{B}\bar{C} + \bar{A}B\bar{C} + A\bar{B}\bar{C} + AB\bar{C}\)

Factor out the common term \(\bar{C}\):
\(Y = \bar{C}(\bar{A}\bar{B} + \bar{A}B + A\bar{B} + AB)\)

Group terms to simplify:
\(Y = \bar{C}[\bar{A}(\bar{B} + B) + A(\bar{B} + B)]\)

Since \(\bar{B} + B = 1\), this reduces to:

A quantum particle is confined in a one-dimensional space of \(0\le x\le 2\). Consider a normalized wavefunction of the particle as

\[
\psi(x)=\sqrt{\frac{p}{5}}[1+\cos(\pi x/2)]\sin(\pi x/2).
\]

Which of the following options gives the correct value of \(p\)?

      String.raw`\(3\)`,
      String.raw`\(4\)`,
      String.raw`\(1\)`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The wavefunction is \(\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{p}{5}}[1 + \cos(\frac{\pi x}{2})]\sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})\).

Expand it: \(\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{p}{5}}[\sin(\frac{\pi x}{2}) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\pi x)]\).

To find \(p\), we use the normalization condition \(\int_{0}^{2} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1\).

\(\int_{0}^{2} [\sin^2(\frac{\pi x}{2}) + \frac{1}{4}\sin^2(\pi x) + \sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})\sin(\pi x)] dx\)

The integral of \(\sin^2\) over its full periods is half the interval:
\(\int_{0}^{2} \sin^2(\frac{\pi x}{2}) dx = 1\) and \(\int_{0}^{2} \sin^2(\pi x) dx = 1\).

The cross term \(\int_{0}^{2} \sin(\frac{\pi x}{2})\sin(\pi x) dx = 0\) due to orthogonality.

Thus, the total integral is \(\frac{p}{5} \times (1 + \frac{1}{4} + 0) = \frac{p}{5} \times \frac{5}{4} = \frac{p}{4}\).

Setting this to 1 gives \(p = 4\).`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The state is \(\psi = c_0 \phi_0 + c_1 \phi_1\), where \(c_0\) and \(c_1\) are imaginary.

Let \(c_0 = i a_0\) and \(c_1 = i a_1\) where \(a_0, a_1\) are real.

The expectation value of position \(\langle x \rangle = \langle \psi | x | \psi \rangle = c_0^* c_1 \langle \phi_0 | x | \phi_1 \rangle + c_1^* c_0 \langle \phi_1 | x | \phi_0 \rangle\).

Notice that \(c_0^* c_1 = (-i a_0)(i a_1) = a_0 a_1\), which is purely real. Thus, \(\langle x \rangle\) is real.

For momentum \(p = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\), the matrix element \(\langle \phi_0 | p | \phi_1 \rangle\) is purely imaginary.

Thus, \(\langle p \rangle\) evaluates to an imaginary number.

The quantity of interest is \(\langle x \rangle + i\langle p \rangle\).

Since \(\langle x \rangle\) is real and \(i\langle p \rangle\) is \(i \times (\text{imaginary}) = \text{real}\), the total sum is purely Real.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The modified potential is \(V(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + 3ax\).

Complete the square to find the new equilibrium position:
\(V(x) = \frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + \frac{6a}{k}x) = \frac{1}{2}k(x + \frac{3a}{k})^2 - \frac{9a^2}{2k}\)

The harmonic frequency \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) remains unchanged, so the energy spacing is unaffected.

The entire energy spectrum is simply shifted downwards by the constant term \(\Delta E = -\frac{9a^2}{2k}\).

Substituting \(a = 2\) and \(k = 1\):

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The general solution to the differential equation \(y'' + \omega^2 y = 0\) is:
\(y(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t)\)

Using the initial condition \(y(0) = \frac{1}{2}\):
\(y(0) = A(1) + B(0) = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow A = \frac{1}{2}\)

Using the derivative initial condition \(y'(0) = 1\):
\(y'(t) = -A\omega \sin(\omega t) + B\omega \cos(\omega t)\)
\(y'(0) = B\omega = 1 \Rightarrow B = \frac{1}{\omega}\)

Thus, \(y(t) = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\omega t) + \frac{1}{\omega}\sin(\omega t)\).

Evaluating at \(t = \frac{\pi}{2\omega}\):
\(y(\frac{\pi}{2\omega}) = \frac{1}{2}\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) + \frac{1}{\omega}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0 + \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{1}{\omega}\)`,

The Lorentz force \(\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B})\) must be invariant in classical mechanics.

In the moving frame, the velocity of the particle is \(\vec{v}' = \vec{v} - \vec{v}_0\).

Equating the forces: \(q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = q(\vec{E}' + \vec{v}' \times \vec{B}')\)

\(q(\vec{E} + \vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = q(\vec{E}' + (\vec{v} - \vec{v}_0) \times \vec{B}')\)

For this to hold for any \(\vec{v}\), the magnetic field must be unchanged (\(\vec{B}' = \vec{B}\)).

The condition for total internal reflection (TIR) occurs when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, which mathematically manifests as \(\sin\theta > 1\).

Evaluating \(n_0 \sin\theta_0\) for the given \(20^\circ\) angle with the horizontal (which means the angle with the normal is \(70^\circ\)), the product exceeds the refractive index of the 3rd layer.

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The given circuit is an ideal difference amplifier.

Using the principle of superposition and the virtual short assumption for the ideal op-amp (where the voltage at the inverting and non-inverting inputs are equal):
Let the resistors be equal \(R\).

The voltage at the non-inverting terminal is \(V_+ = V_1 \frac{R}{R+R} = \frac{V_1}{2}\).

Applying Kirchhoff's current law at the inverting terminal (\(V_-\)):
\(\frac{V_2 - V_-}{R} = \frac{V_- - V_0}{R}\)

Since \(V_- = V_+ = \frac{V_1}{2}\), substituting gives:
\(V_2 - \frac{V_1}{2} = \frac{V_1}{2} - V_0\)

\(V_0 = \frac{V_1}{2} + \frac{V_1}{2} - V_2 = V_1 - V_2\).`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a mass-spring system, the time period is \(T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\).

When the mass is attached, the spring stretches by \(\Delta x\) to reach equilibrium, so the restoring force equals weight: \(k\Delta x = mg \Rightarrow \frac{m}{k} = \frac{\Delta x}{g}\).

Substitute this into the period equation:
\(T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\Delta x}{g}}\)

Given \(T = 0.2\) s and \(g = 9.8\) m/s\(^2\):
\(0.2 = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\Delta x}{9.8}} \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{\Delta x}{9.8}} = \frac{0.2}{2\pi} = \frac{0.1}{\pi}\)

Squaring both sides:

At point \(P\), velocity is \(\vec{v}_1\). At point \(Q\), velocity is \(\vec{v}_2\). Both have magnitude \(v\).

The angle between \(\vec{v}_1\) and \(\vec{v}_2\) is \(\theta\).

The change in velocity is \(\Delta\vec{v} = \vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_1\).

The resistance is given as \(R = 40 \, \Omega\).

The total impedance is:

Peak current \(I_0 = \frac{E_0}{Z} = \frac{50}{50} = 1\) A.

The peak voltage across each component:
\(V_R = I_0 R = 40\) V

For standing waves, the nodes occur where the amplitude is permanently zero.
The amplitude is zero when \(\cos(kx) = 0\).

Typically, \(V_i > V_z\), so \(V_i\) must be greater than 20V (depending on the load, but assuming unloaded, \(V_i \ge 20\) V).

To prevent burnout, the current must not exceed \(60\) mA.
Without the exact resistor values from the image, we rely on the options. Based on typical circuit constraints, input voltages of \(25\) V and \(35\) V will turn the diode ON and safely operate within the bounds.`,

Consider a particle of mass \(m\) in a rotating frame. The force acting on the particle is expressed as

\[
\vec{F}=(F_1+F_2)\,\hat e_r+(F_3+F_4)\,\hat e_\theta,
\]

where \(\hat e_r\) and \(\hat e_\theta\) are the radial and angular unit vectors, respectively, and

\[
F_1=m\ddot r,\qquad
F_2=-mr\dot\theta^2,\qquad
F_3=mr\ddot\theta,\qquad
F_4=2m\dot r\dot\theta.
\]

Which of the following statements is/are correct?

    options: [
      String.raw`\(\hat e_r\) and \(\hat e_\theta\) are not constant unit vectors`,

      String.raw`\(F_2\) and \(F_4\) are fictitious forces`,

      String.raw`\(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are zero in uniform circular motion`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In a rotating frame of reference, Newton's second law requires the introduction of fictitious forces.
The general force equation in polar coordinates includes both real radial/tangential forces and fictitious forces.

The terms in the expression are identified as follows:
- \(F_1 = m\ddot{r}\) is the real radial acceleration force (in the absence of rotation).
- \(F_2 = -mr\dot{\theta}^2\) is the centrifugal force, which is a fictitious force acting radially outwards.
- \(F_3 = mr\ddot{\theta}\) is the Euler force, which is a fictitious tangential force if the angular velocity changes.
- \(F_4 = 2m\dot{r}\dot{\theta}\) is the Coriolis force, which is a fictitious force perpendicular to the velocity in the rotating frame.

Furthermore, the unit vectors \(\hat{e}_r\) and \(\hat{e}_\theta\) continuously change direction as the particle moves or the frame rotates, making them non-constant.
Therefore, options stating that \(\hat{e}_r\) and \(\hat{e}_\theta\) are not constant, and that \(F_2\) and \(F_4\) are fictitious forces, are correct.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In special relativity, the spacetime interval \(\Delta s^2\) determines whether the separation between two events is space-like, time-like, or light-like.
The interval is given by:
\(\Delta s^2 = c^2\Delta t^2 - (\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2)\)

For the events \((9,-1,1,-1)\) and \((-10,1,0,-1)\):
\(\Delta ct = -10 - 9 = -19 \Rightarrow (c\Delta t)^2 = (-19)^2 = 361\)
\(\Delta x = 1 - (-1) = 2 \Rightarrow \Delta x^2 = 4\)
\(\Delta y = 0 - 1 = -1 \Rightarrow \Delta y^2 = 1\)
\(\Delta z = -1 - (-1) = 0 \Rightarrow \Delta z^2 = 0\)

\(\Delta s^2 = 361 - (4 + 1 + 0) = 361 - 5 = 356\)

Since \(\Delta s^2 > 0\), the interval is strictly positive, which means the events are **time-like separated**.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The potential energy is \(U(x) = -\frac{1}{2} kx^2\).
The total energy is conserved: \(E = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 + U(x) < 0\).

Expressing the velocity \(v\) as a function of position \(x\):
\(\frac{1}{2} mv^2 = E - U(x) = E + \frac{1}{2} kx^2\)
\(v^2 = \frac{k}{m}x^2 + \frac{2E}{m}\)
\(v(x) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}x^2 - \frac{2|E|}{m}}\)

This equation represents a hyperbola in the phase-space (\(v\) vs. \(x\)) plane.
Since \(v^2 \ge 0\), we must have \(\frac{k}{m}x^2 \ge \frac{2|E|}{m}\), meaning the particle cannot exist in the region near the origin where \(|x| < \sqrt{\frac{2|E|}{k}}\).
Therefore, the plot will consist of two separate hyperbolic branches that do not cross the v-axis, corresponding to the correct plot.`,

      String.raw`The maximum potential difference across the inductor is \(2.0~V\)`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For the ideal LC oscillator, energy oscillates between the capacitor and inductor without loss.
Energy conservation: \(\frac{1}{2} C V_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2} L I_{max}^2\)
Solving for \(L\):
\(L = C (\frac{V_{max}}{I_{max}})^2 = 4 \times 10^{-6} \times (\frac{2}{0.080})^2 = 4 \times 10^{-6} \times (25)^2 = 4 \times 10^{-6} \times 625 = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}\) H \(= 2.5\) mH.

The angular frequency is:
\(\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.5 \times 10^{-3} \times 4 \times 10^{-6}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10^{-8}}} = 10^4\) rad/s.
The frequency \(f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{10000}{2\pi} \approx 1591\) Hz \(= 1.59\) kHz (not 3.2 kHz).

The time to charge from zero to maximum is one quarter of a period (\(T/4\)):
\(T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4}\) s \(= 0.628\) ms.
\(\frac{T}{4} = \frac{0.628}{4} \approx 0.157\) ms.

By Kirchhoff's loop rule, the max potential difference across the inductor must equal the max potential difference across the capacitor, which is 2.0 V.`,

      String.raw`Internal energy of the gas depends both on temperature and pressure`
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For an ideal gas, there are no intermolecular forces, so the internal energy does not depend on the volume or pressure.
According to Joule's law, the internal energy of an ideal gas is a function strictly of its temperature, \(U = U(T)\).

The entropy \(S\) of an ideal gas changes as \(dS = \frac{C_v dT}{T} + \frac{P dV}{T}\).
Since \(P/T = R/V\), we get \(S \propto R \ln V\) at constant temperature, but \(S\) is not simply proportional to \(\ln V\) generally without temperature bounds, and \(S\) is never zero globally.

Thus, the only unconditionally correct statement is that the internal energy depends only on the temperature.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The magnetic field produced by the small moving loop \(Q\) (acting as a magnetic dipole) at a large distance \(s\) along its axis is given by the dipole field formula:
\(B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{2\mu}{s^3}\), where \(\mu = I \pi R_2^2\).
Thus, the magnetic field \(B\) at the center of \(P\) is proportional to \(\frac{1}{s^3}\).

The magnetic flux \(\Phi\) through loop \(P\) is roughly \(B \times \text{Area}_P \propto \frac{1}{s^3}\).

According to Faraday's Law, the induced emf \(\varepsilon\) in loop \(P\) is the rate of change of magnetic flux:
\(\varepsilon = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = -\frac{d\Phi}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt}\)
Since \(\Phi = \frac{C}{s^3}\), the derivative is \(\frac{d\Phi}{ds} = -\frac{3C}{s^4}\).
Given \(\frac{ds}{dt} = v\), the emf becomes \(\varepsilon = \frac{3C v}{s^4}\).

This shows that the induced emf is directly proportional to \(\frac{1}{s^4}\) and linearly proportional to \(v\).`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Let the inner sphere of radius \(R\) have charge \(Q\).
The outer concentric conducting hollow sphere of radius \(2R\) is earthed (grounded), meaning its potential is \(V = 0\).

By Gauss's Law, to maintain an electric field of zero inside the bulk of the outer conducting sphere, a charge of \(-Q\) must be induced on its inner surface.

Since the outer sphere is earthed and the electric field outside an earthed enclosure with no external charges is zero, the charge on the outer surface of the outer sphere must be exactly zero.

The potential in the region between the spheres (\(R < r < 2R\)) is determined by the inner charge and the boundary condition at \(2R\):
\(V(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r} + C\)
Since \(V(2R) = 0\), \(C = -\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 (2R)}\).
Thus, \(V(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} (\frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{2R})\), which contradicts the provided option.`,

      "Two thermodynamic systems separated by diathermic wall have the equations of state $U_1 = \\frac{3}{2} R N_1 T_1$ and $U_2 = \\frac{5}{2} R N_2 T_2$, where $R$ is the gas constant. $N_1, N_2$ and $T_1, T_2$ are the mole numbers and the temperature of the two systems, respectively. The composite system in equilibrium has the total energy $1.5 \\times 10^3$ Joule. If $N_1 = 3$ and $N_2 = 2$, then the internal energy $U_1$ of the system one is ________.\n\n(Answer in integer)",
    detailedSolution: String.raw`The composite system is isolated and in equilibrium, meaning the two sub-systems share the same final temperature \(T\).

The total internal energy is \(U_{total} = U_1 + U_2 = 1.5 \times 10^3\) J.
Given the equations of state:
\(U_1 = \frac{3}{2} R N_1 T\)
\(U_2 = \frac{5}{2} R N_2 T\)

Summing them gives the total energy:
\(U_{total} = (\frac{3}{2} N_1 + \frac{5}{2} N_2) R T\)
Substitute \(N_1 = 3\) and \(N_2 = 2\):
\(U_{total} = (\frac{3}{2}(3) + \frac{5}{2}(2)) R T = (\frac{9}{2} + 5) R T = 9.5 R T = 1500\) J.

We need to find the internal energy \(U_1\):
\(U_1 = \frac{3}{2} (3) R T = 4.5 R T\)

Take the ratio:
\(\frac{U_1}{U_{total}} = \frac{4.5 R T}{9.5 R T} = \frac{4.5}{9.5} = \frac{9}{19}\)
\(U_1 = \frac{9}{19} \times 1500 = \frac{13500}{19} \approx 710.52\) J.

    detailedSolution: String.raw`According to Einstein's photoelectric equation:
\(K_{max} = E - \Phi\)
where \(E\) is the energy of the incident photon and \(\Phi\) is the work function of the metal.

Calculate the incident photon energy \(E\) using \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\):
\(E = \frac{6.625 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{500 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{19.875 \times 10^{-26}}{5 \times 10^{-7}} = 3.975 \times 10^{-19}\) J.
Convert to eV (divide by \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\)):
\(E = \frac{3.975}{1.6} \approx 2.484\) eV.

Calculate the work function \(\Phi\) using the threshold wavelength \(\lambda_{th}\):

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Bragg's Law for X-ray diffraction is:

For a simple cubic structure, the interplanar spacing \(d\) for the \((h k l)\) planes is given by:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The root-mean-square (\(rms\)) speed of a gas molecule is given by:
\(v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3k_B T}{m}}\)

This shows that \(v_{rms}\) is directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature (\(v_{rms} \propto \sqrt{T}\)).

Let the initial state be \(T_1 = 300\) K with speed \(v_1\).
We want to find the temperature \(T_2\) such that the speed is \(v_2 = 2v_1\).

Using the proportionality:
\(\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}\)
\(2 = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{300}}\)

Due to time dilation, the lifetime measured by the ground observer is \(\Delta t = \gamma \tau_0\), where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\).

The distance traveled in the ground frame is \(d = v \Delta t = v \gamma \tau_0\).
Given \(d = 6000\) m:
\(6000 = \frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \times 2.2 \times 10^{-6}\)

The minimum thickness of the water film, in $\\mu m$, is ______ .\n\n(Rounded off to two decimal places)\n\n[Assume refractive index is independent of wavelength]",
    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a thin film of water (\(n = 1.33\)) on a substrate, light reflected from the top surface undergoes a \(\pi\) phase shift.
The condition for maximum reflection (constructive interference) is:
\(2nt \cos\theta_r = (m_1 + \frac{1}{2})\lambda_1\)

The condition for zero reflection (destructive interference) is:
\(2nt \cos\theta_r = m_2\lambda_2\)

First, find the angle of refraction \(\theta_r\) using Snell's Law (\(1 \sin 30^\circ = 1.33 \sin\theta_r\)):
\(\sin\theta_r = \frac{0.5}{1.33} \approx 0.376\)
\(\cos\theta_r = \sqrt{1 - 0.376^2} \approx 0.927\)

Equating the optical path difference \(2nt \cos\theta_r\):
\((m_1 + 0.5)(0.64) = m_2(0.40)\)
\(1.6m_1 + 0.8 = m_2\)

For \(m_2\) to be the smallest possible integer, testing \(m_1 = 0, 1, 2\):
If \(m_1 = 2\), \(m_2 = 1.6(2) + 0.8 = 3.2 + 0.8 = 4\) (which is an integer).
So the path difference is \(4 \times 0.40 = 1.6\ \mu\)m.

\(\langle E \rangle = \hbar \omega [ \frac{1}{2}(2) + \frac{1}{4}(2) ] = \hbar \omega [ 1 + 0.5 ] = 1.5 \hbar \omega\).

Since \(\hbar \omega = \frac{h}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\), the energy is:
\(\langle E \rangle = 1.5 \frac{h}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = 0.75 \frac{h}{\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\).

    detailedSolution: String.raw`By the Divergence Theorem, the surface integral of a vector field \(\mathbf{r}\) over a closed surface \(S\) enclosing a volume \(V\) is equal to the volume integral of its divergence:
\(\oiint_S \mathbf{r} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \iiint_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{r}) \, dV\)

The position vector is \(\mathbf{r} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j} + z\hat{k}\).
Its divergence is:
\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{r} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial z} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\)

Substitute this into the volume integral:
\(\iiint_V 3 \, dV = 3 \iiint_V dV = 3V\)

The expression given in the question includes a factor of \(\frac{1}{9}\):
\(\frac{1}{9} \oiint_S \mathbf{r} \cdot \hat{n} \, dS = \frac{1}{9}(3V) = \frac{V}{3}\)`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Let the initial momenta of the two particles be \(\vec{p}_{1i} = m_1 v_1 \hat{i}\) and \(\vec{p}_{2i} = m_2 v_2 \hat{j}\).
After the elastic collision, they move away in perpendicular directions, so their final momenta \(\vec{p}_{1f}\) and \(\vec{p}_{2f}\) satisfy \(\vec{p}_{1f} \cdot \vec{p}_{2f} = 0\).

By conservation of momentum:
\(\vec{p}_{1i} + \vec{p}_{2i} = \vec{p}_{1f} + \vec{p}_{2f}\)

Squaring both sides (taking the dot product of the vector sum with itself):
\(|\vec{p}_{1i}|^2 + |\vec{p}_{2i}|^2 + 2\vec{p}_{1i} \cdot \vec{p}_{2i} = |\vec{p}_{1f}|^2 + |\vec{p}_{2f}|^2 + 2\vec{p}_{1f} \cdot \vec{p}_{2f}\)
Since both the initial and final momentum vectors are perpendicular, their dot products are zero:
\(p_{1i}^2 + p_{2i}^2 = p_{1f}^2 + p_{2f}^2\)

By conservation of kinetic energy:
\(\frac{p_{1i}^2}{2m_1} + \frac{p_{2i}^2}{2m_2} = \frac{p_{1f}^2}{2m_1} + \frac{p_{2f}^2}{2m_2}\)

These two equations hold simultaneously if the particles effectively exchange the magnitudes of their momenta in the respective orthogonal axes, taking mass into account. The kinematic result yields \(m_1 v_1' = m_2 v_2\) and \(m_2 v_2' = m_1 v_1\).
Solving for the velocities:
\(v_1' = \frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1}\)
\(v_2' = \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_2}\)

The ratio is:
\(\frac{v_2'}{v_1'} = \frac{\frac{m_1 v_1}{m_2}}{\frac{m_2 v_2}{m_1}} = \frac{m_1^2 v_1}{m_2^2 v_2}\)`,

Ray 2 passes from Air \(\to\) Medium P \(\to\) Medium Q \(\to\) Air.
Because the interfaces are parallel, Snell's Law applies continuously across the boundaries:
\(n_{air} \sin\theta_{inc} = n_P \sin\theta_P = n_Q \sin\theta_Q = n_{air} \sin\theta_{exit}\)
Thus, \(\theta_{exit} = \theta_{inc} = 45^\circ\). Ray 2 emerges parallel to the original incident ray.

Ray 1 passes from Air \(\to\) Medium P \(\to\) Air \(\to\) Medium Q \(\to\) Air.
Similarly, since all boundaries are parallel to each other, the same continuous application of Snell's Law applies. The final medium is air, so it will also emerge at an angle of \(45^\circ\) to the normal.

Since both rays emerge into the air at the exact same angle of \(45^\circ\), they remain parallel to each other.
The angular deviation between them is exactly \(0\) radians.`,

To utilize Gauss's Law effectively, we can exploit symmetry. Imagine constructing an identical inverted square pyramid directly below the first one, sharing the same base.
This creates a closed regular octahedron, and the charge \(q\) is now positioned exactly at its geometric center.

According to Gauss's Law, the total outward electric flux through the entire closed octahedral surface is \(\Phi_{total} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0}\).

An octahedron has 8 identical slanted triangular faces, and the charge is symmetrically located at the center. Therefore, the flux is distributed equally across all 8 faces.

The outward electric flux across a single slanted face is:

Integrate with respect to \(x\) to find the electric field (related to the first derivative):

Integrate a second time to find the potential:
\(V(x) = -\frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} e^{-x} + C_1 x + C_2\)

Apply the boundary conditions \(V(0) = 0\) and \(V(d) = 0\):

2) \(V(d) = -\frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} e^{-d} + C_1 d + \frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} = 0 \Rightarrow C_1 = \frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^{-d} - 1}{d}\).

Substitute \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) back into the potential equation:
\(V(x) = -\frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} e^{-x} + \frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} \frac{e^{-d} - 1}{d} x + \frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0}\)

Factor out \(\frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0}\):
\(V(x) = \frac{\rho_0}{\varepsilon_0} \left[ 1 - e^{-x} - \frac{1 - e^{-d}}{d} x \right]\)

1) Inside the inner sphere (\(r < a\)):
The sphere is made of metal (a conductor), so the electric field inside is strictly zero. \(E = 0\).

2) Between the spheres (\(a < r < 2a\)):
The Gaussian surface encloses only the charge \(Q\) on the inner sphere.
\(E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0} \Rightarrow E = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2}\).
At \(r = a\), the field jumps from 0 to a finite value, and then decays as \(\frac{1}{r^2}\).

We are given that \((T_{1/2})_B < (T_{1/2})_A\). Since the decay constant \(\lambda = \frac{\ln 2}{T_{1/2}}\), this means \(\lambda_B > \lambda_A\).
Thus, the exponential term \(e^{-\lambda_B t}\) decays much faster than \(e^{-\lambda_A t}\).

For a time \(t \gg (T_{1/2})_A\), sufficient time has passed such that both exponentials are small, but \(e^{-\lambda_B t}\) is completely negligible compared to \(e^{-\lambda_A t}\).
We can approximate:
\((N_B)_t \approx \frac{\lambda_A}{\lambda_B - \lambda_A} (N_A)_0 e^{-\lambda_A t}\)

Since the number of nuclides of A at time \(t\) is \((N_A)_t = (N_A)_0 e^{-\lambda_A t}\), we can substitute this into the equation:

\(\det(A) = 1(-a - 2m) - m(-2 - am) + a(4 - a^2)\)
\(\det(A) = -a - 2m + 2m + am^2 + 4a - a^3\)

Simplify and set it to zero:
\(3a + am^2 - a^3 = 0\)

Since \(a\) is a non-zero constant, we can divide the entire equation by \(a\):
\(3 + m^2 - a^2 = 0\)
\(m^2 - a^2 = -3\).`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`First, simplify the complex fraction inside the parenthesis by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
\(\frac{1-i}{1+i} = \frac{(1-i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = \frac{1 - 2i + i^2}{1^2 - i^2}\)

Since \(i^2 = -1\):
\(\frac{1 - 2i - 1}{1 - (-1)} = \frac{-2i}{2} = -i\)

The equation becomes:
\((-i)^{\frac{n}{2}} = -1\)

In polar form, \(-i = e^{-i\pi/2}\) and \(-1 = e^{i\pi}\).
\((e^{-i\pi/2})^{\frac{n}{2}} = e^{-i\pi n / 4}\)

For this to equal \(-1 = e^{i\pi (1 + 2k)}\), the arguments must match:
\(-\frac{\pi n}{4} = \pi + 2k\pi\)
\(-\frac{n}{4} = 1 + 2k \Rightarrow n = -4(1 + 2k)\)

Testing integers for \(k\):
If \(k = -1\), then \(n = -4(1 - 2) = -4(-1) = 4\).
Therefore, \(n=4\) is a valid solution.`,

Step 1: Calculate the Jacobian of \((u,v)\) with respect to \((x,y)\).

\(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = x, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -y\)

Consider one of the masses \(M\). It experiences gravitational attraction from the other two masses. The force from each is \(\frac{GM^2}{d^2}\), and the angle between these two force vectors is \(60^\circ\).
The net gravitational force pointing strictly towards the center of mass is:
\(F_g = 2 \frac{GM^2}{d^2} \cos(30^\circ) = 2 \frac{GM^2}{d^2} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}GM^2}{d^2}\)

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The mass \(M_2\) is pushed a distance \(x\), compressing the spring, and storing a potential energy of \(U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2\).

When \(M_2\) is released, it accelerates towards \(M_1\) (which is held in place by the rigid wall). The spring pushes against the wall.
When the spring reaches its natural length, all potential energy has been converted into the kinetic energy of \(M_2\):
\(\frac{1}{2} M_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x^2 \Rightarrow v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{M_2}} x\)

At this exact moment, the spring begins to stretch, and it starts pulling \(M_1\) away from the wall. Since the wall can only push and not pull, \(M_1\) leaves the wall.
From this point forward, there are no external forces acting on the composite system (\(M_1 + M_2\)) in the horizontal direction.

Therefore, the momentum of the center of mass is conserved. The total momentum is \(p = M_2 v_2\).
\(p = M_2 \sqrt{\frac{k}{M_2}} x = \sqrt{k M_2} x\)

The speed of the center of mass is the total momentum divided by the total mass:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`As the chain is lifted, two forces must be considered: the weight of the hanging chain, and the force required to continuously accelerate links of the chain from rest to velocity \(v\).

1. **Weight Force**:
At height \(H\), the mass of the hanging portion is \(m = \rho H\).
The force required to support this weight is \(W = mg = \rho H g\).

2. **Momentum Force (Thrust)**:
The chain is being lifted at a constant speed \(v\). In a small time interval \(dt\), a mass \(dm = \rho dx = \rho v dt\) is picked up from the ground and abruptly accelerated from \(0\) to \(v\).
The rate of change of momentum is:
\(\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{dm}{dt} v = (\rho v) v = \rho v^2\)

The total applied force \(F\) must provide both the lift for the weight and the thrust for the momentum change:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In a two-slit Fraunhofer diffraction experiment, the intensity pattern is a product of single-slit diffraction and double-slit interference.

The condition for single-slit diffraction minima is:
\(b \sin\theta = m\lambda\) (where \(b = 0.1\) mm is the slit width).
The first diffraction minima occur at \(\sin\theta = \pm \frac{\lambda}{0.1}\).

The condition for double-slit interference minima is:
\(d \sin\theta = (n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda\) (where \(d = 0.8\) mm is the slit separation).
\(\sin\theta = (n + \frac{1}{2})\frac{\lambda}{0.8}\)

We want to find the number of interference minima that fall *strictly between* the first diffraction minima:
\(-\frac{\lambda}{0.1} < (n + \frac{1}{2})\frac{\lambda}{0.8} < \frac{\lambda}{0.1}\)

Divide by \(\lambda\) and multiply by \(0.8\):
\(-\frac{0.8}{0.1} < n + \frac{1}{2} < \frac{0.8}{0.1}\)
\(-8 < n + 0.5 < 8\)
\(-8.5 < n < 7.5\)

So, \(y_2 = -b \cos(\omega t) \Rightarrow \cos(\omega t) = -\frac{y_2}{b}\).

Next, use the double-angle identity for cosine on \(y_1\):
\(\cos(2\omega t) = 2\cos^2(\omega t) - 1\)
Substitute this into the \(y_1\) equation:
\(y_1 = a [2\cos^2(\omega t) - 1]\)

Notice that \(\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3} = \frac{n_g}{n_a}\).
This means the angle of incidence is exactly the **Brewster's angle**.

At Brewster's angle, the reflection coefficient for the \(p\)-polarized light (the in-plane or parallel component) is exactly zero. Consequently, 100% of the in-plane electric field component is transmitted across the interface.
Since the interfaces of the slab are parallel, the light will hit the second interface (glass to air) exactly at its respective Brewster's angle as well, leading to 100% transmission of the in-plane component once again.

Therefore, the in-plane (\(x-y\)) electric field component passes through the entire glass slab completely unaffected.
Its amplitude remains exactly \(4\) V/m.`,

The rest mass \(M\) of the composite particle is found using the relativistic invariant \(E^2 - (pc)^2 = (Mc^2)^2\):
\((Mc^2)^2 = (3m \gamma c^2)^2 - (m \gamma v c)^2\)
\(M^2 c^4 = 9m^2 \gamma^2 c^4 - m^2 \gamma^2 v^2 c^2\)

Divide the entire equation by \(c^4\):
\(M^2 = \gamma^2 m^2 (9 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}) = \gamma^2 m^2 (9 - \beta^2)\)

Substitute \(\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1-\beta^2}\):
\(M^2 = m^2 \frac{9-\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}\)

Taking the square root gives the rest mass:
\(M = m\sqrt{\frac{9-\beta^2}{1-\beta^2}}\).`,

    ],
    detailedSolution: String.raw`The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is \(i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\psi\).

First, find the time derivative:
\(i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = i\hbar (i\frac{\gamma}{\hbar}) \psi = -\gamma \psi\)
So, \(-\gamma \psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\psi\).

Next, compute the second spatial derivative of the wavefunction \(\psi = \alpha x^2 e^{-\beta x} e^{i\gamma t/\hbar}\).
Ignoring constants for the spatial differentiation, let \(\phi = x^2 e^{-\beta x}\):
\(\phi' = 2x e^{-\beta x} - \beta x^2 e^{-\beta x}\)
\(\phi'' = 2 e^{-\beta x} - 2\beta x e^{-\beta x} - 2\beta x e^{-\beta x} + \beta^2 x^2 e^{-\beta x}\)
\(\phi'' = (2 - 4\beta x + \beta^2 x^2) e^{-\beta x}\)

Divide \(\psi''\) by \(\psi\):
\(\frac{\psi''}{\psi} = \frac{\phi''}{\phi} = \frac{2 - 4\beta x + \beta^2 x^2}{x^2} = \frac{2}{x^2} - \frac{4\beta}{x} + \beta^2\)

Substitute back into the Schrödinger equation and solve for \(V(x)\):
\(-\gamma \psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} (\frac{2}{x^2} - \frac{4\beta}{x} + \beta^2)\psi + V(x)\psi\)

      "$m_1p_1'+m_2p_2'=m_1p_1+m_2p_2$",
    ],
    detailedSolution: String.raw`Galilean invariance implies that fundamental physical laws, like the conservation of momentum, hold true in all inertial frames of reference.

In frame \(S\), the total momentum is \(P = p_1 + p_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2\).
In frame \(S'\) (moving with velocity \(V\) relative to \(S\)), the velocities are \(v_1' = v_1 - V\) and \(v_2' = v_2 - V\).
The momenta in \(S'\) are:
\(p_1' = m_1 v_1' = m_1(v_1 - V) = p_1 - m_1 V\)
\(p_2' = m_2 v_2' = m_2(v_2 - V) = p_2 - m_2 V\)

To find a relation that is independent of the relative frame velocity \(V\), we can eliminate \(V\).
From the first equation: \(V = \frac{p_1 - p_1'}{m_1}\).
From the second equation: \(V = \frac{p_2 - p_2'}{m_2}\).

Equating them:
\(\frac{p_1 - p_1'}{m_1} = \frac{p_2 - p_2'}{m_2}\)

Cross-multiply to rearrange the terms:
\(m_2(p_1 - p_1') = m_1(p_2 - p_2')\)
\(m_2 p_1 - m_2 p_1' = m_1 p_2 - m_1 p_2'\)
\(m_2 p_1' - m_1 p_2' = m_2 p_1 - m_1 p_2\)

This relation represents the invariant property of the transformation.`,

    ],
    detailedSolution: String.raw`The binding energy formula is based on the semi-empirical mass formula (liquid drop model).
We want to evaluate the difference \(B(A,Z) - B(A,Z')\) for mirror nuclei.
For a mirror nucleus, the atomic number \(Z'\) is simply the original number of neutrons \(N\), meaning \(Z' = A - Z = N\).

Let's examine how the terms in the formula change when \(Z\) is replaced by \(N\):
1) \(a_1 A\): Depends only on \(A\). (Symmetric)
2) \(a_2 A^{2/3}\): Depends only on \(A\). (Symmetric)
3) \(a_4 \frac{(A - 2Z)^2}{A}\): When \(Z\) becomes \(N\), the term is \((A - 2N)^2\). Since \(A = Z + N\), \(A - 2N = Z - N = -(A - 2Z)\). Squaring it yields \((A - 2Z)^2\), so this term is also perfectly symmetric and unchanged.

The only term that differs between the mirror nuclei is the Coulomb term, \(a_3 \frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}\).
Subtracting the binding energies cancels out all symmetric terms:
\(B(A,Z) - B(A,N) = \left( -a_3 \frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}} \right) - \left( -a_3 \frac{N^2}{A^{1/3}} \right)\)
\(= \frac{a_3}{A^{1/3}} (N^2 - Z^2) = -\frac{a_3}{A^{1/3}} (Z^2 - N^2)\).

Thus, the difference is directly proportional to \((Z^2 - N^2)\).`,

\(\vec{J} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} [ \hat{i}(\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial y}) - \hat{j}(\frac{\partial B_z}{\partial x}) ]\)

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The two particles interact via gravity and rotate about their common center of mass.
Let the distances from the center of mass be \(r_1\) and \(r_2\).
By the definition of the center of mass:
\(m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2\)
This means Option D (\(m_2 r_1 = m_1 r_2\)) is incorrect because the subscripts are swapped.

They orbit with the same angular velocity \(\omega\).
The magnitude of angular momentum for each is:
\(L_1 = m_1 v_1 r_1 = m_1 (\omega r_1) r_1 = m_1 \omega r_1^2\)
\(L_2 = m_2 \omega r_2^2\)
Taking the ratio:
\(\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{m_1 r_1^2}{m_2 r_2^2} = \frac{m_1 r_1}{m_2 r_2} \left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right) = (1) \left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right) = \frac{m_2}{m_1}\) (Option A is correct)

The kinetic energy for each is:

\(K_2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 \omega^2 r_2^2\)
Taking the ratio:
\(\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{m_1 r_1^2}{m_2 r_2^2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1}\) (Option B is correct)

By equating the gravitational force to the centripetal force:
\(\frac{G m_1 m_2}{(r_1+r_2)^2} = m_1 \omega^2 r_1\)
Using \(r_1 = \frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}(r_1+r_2)\), we get Kepler's Third Law:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The spherical ball has a total charge \(Q\). Even as its radius \(R\) pulsates by \(\pm 10\%\) with frequency \(\omega\), the total enclosed charge remains constant at \(Q\).

According to Gauss's Law, the net outward electric flux through any closed surface enclosing the entire charge is given by:
\(\Phi_E = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}\)

For a spherical surface of radius \(r = 2R\), the maximum pulsating radius of the ball is \(1.1R\). Thus, the surface at \(r=2R\) always completely encloses the entire ball.
The enclosed charge is always \(Q\), meaning the flux is perfectly constant: \(\Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}\).
It does not pulsate or change over time.

Similarly, the electric potential outside a spherically symmetric charge distribution behaves exactly like a point charge at the origin. Since the total charge \(Q\) is constant, the potential at \(r=2R\) is \(V = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\frac{Q}{2R}\), which is constant and does not fluctuate.

Inside the sphere (\(r=0.5R\)), the charge density changes as the sphere expands and contracts, which means the enclosed charge and electric field at that point will be time-dependent.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Thermal equilibrium between systems implies that their temperatures are equal.
For an ideal gas, temperature \(T\) is proportional to the product of pressure and volume, \(PV\).
Let's define an empirical temperature scale \(\theta\) such that for any gas, \(\theta = f(P,V)\).

From Condition (I): \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) are in equilibrium (\(\theta_1 = \theta_2\)).
\(P_1V_1 - P_2V_2 + \alpha P_2 = 0 \Rightarrow P_1V_1 = P_2(V_2 - \alpha)\)
This suggests the temperature function is \(\theta_1 = P_1V_1\) and \(\theta_2 = P_2(V_2 - \alpha)\).

From Condition (II): \(G_1\) and \(G_3\) are in equilibrium (\(\theta_1 = \theta_3\)).
\(P_3V_3 - P_1V_1 + \frac{\beta P_1V_1}{V_3} = 0 \Rightarrow P_3V_3 = P_1V_1 \left(1 - \frac{\beta}{V_3}\right)\)
Rearranging gives: \(P_3V_3 + P_1V_1 \left(\frac{\beta}{V_3} - 1\right) = 0\) (This matches Option D)
Also, solving for \(\theta_1 = P_1V_1\), we get \(\theta_3 = \frac{P_3V_3}{1 - \beta/V_3}\).

If \(G_2\) and \(G_3\) are in thermal equilibrium, their temperatures must be equal (\(\theta_2 = \theta_3\)):
\(P_2(V_2 - \alpha) = \frac{P_3V_3}{1 - \beta/V_3}\)
\(P_3V_3 - (P_2V_2 - \alpha P_2)\left(1 - \frac{\beta}{V_3}\right) = 0\) (This matches Option A)`,

An ideal mono-atomic gas is expanded adiabatically from \(A\) to \(B\). It is then compressed in an isobaric process from \(B\) to \(C\). Finally, the pressure is increased in an isochoric process from \(C\) to \(A\).

The cyclic process is shown in the figure below. For this system, which of the following is(are) correct?

      String.raw`Total change in internal energy during the entire process is
\[
\frac{5}{2}P_2(V_2-V_1)
\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The cycle consists of three processes: \(A \to B\) (adiabatic expansion), \(B \to C\) (isobaric compression), and \(C \to A\) (isochoric heating).

1) **Adiabatic Process (\(A \to B\))**:
The work done by an ideal gas during adiabatic expansion is \(W_{AB} = \frac{P_A V_A - P_B V_B}{\gamma - 1}\).
For a mono-atomic gas, the adiabatic index \(\gamma = \frac{5}{3}\), so \(\gamma - 1 = \frac{2}{3}\).
From the graph, \(P_A = P_1, V_A = V_1\) and \(P_B = P_2, V_B = V_2\).
\(W_{AB} = \frac{3}{2}(P_1V_1 - P_2V_2)\). (Option A is incorrect, missing 3/2)

2) **Isobaric Process (\(B \to C\))**:
The pressure is constant at \(P_2\). The volume changes from \(V_2\) to \(V_C = V_1\).
Work done is \(W_{BC} = P_2(V_C - V_B) = P_2(V_1 - V_2)\).

3) **Isochoric Process (\(C \to A\))**:
The volume is constant, so no work is done. \(W_{CA} = 0\).

The total work done during the entire cycle is the sum of the work from each step:
\(W_{total} = W_{AB} + W_{BC} + W_{CA} = \frac{3}{2}(P_1V_1 - P_2V_2) + P_2(V_1 - V_2)\).
This matches exactly with Option B.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In X-ray diffraction, constructive interference (Bragg peaks) occurs only for specific lattice planes depending on the crystal structure.
This is determined by the structure factor selection rules.

For a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice, the selection rule states that a diffraction peak is only observed if the sum of the Miller indices \((h + k + l)\) is an **even** integer.

Let's test the given values of \(h^2 + k^2 + l^2\):
- **3**: Can only be formed by \(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2\). Here \(h,k,l = 1,1,1\). Sum \(= 3\) (odd). No peak.
- **4**: Can only be formed by \(2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2\). Here \(h,k,l = 2,0,0\). Sum \(= 2\) (even). **Peak observed**.
- **5**: Can only be formed by \(2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2\). Here \(h,k,l = 2,1,0\). Sum \(= 3\) (odd). No peak.
- **7**: No combination of three integer squares can sum to 7.

Therefore, a peak is observed only for \(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 4\).`,

Two solid cylinders of the same density are found to have the same moment of inertia about their respective principal axes.

The length of the second cylinder is \(16\) times that of the first cylinder.

If the radius of the first cylinder is \(4\ \text{cm}\), the radius of the second cylinder is \_\_\_\_\_ cm. (in integer)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The moment of inertia for a solid cylinder rotating about its central principal axis is given by:
\(I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2\)

The mass \(M\) can be expressed in terms of the uniform density \(\rho\), radius \(R\), and length \(L\):
\(M = \rho \times \text{Volume} = \rho \pi R^2 L\)

Substitute this into the moment of inertia formula:
\(I = \frac{1}{2} (\rho \pi R^2 L) R^2 = \frac{\pi \rho}{2} R^4 L\)

We are given that both cylinders have the same density and the same moment of inertia (\(I_1 = I_2\)):
\(R_1^4 L_1 = R_2^4 L_2\)

We are also given that the length of the second cylinder is 16 times that of the first (\(L_2 = 16 L_1\)), and the radius of the first is \(R_1 = 4\) cm.
\(4^4 L_1 = R_2^4 (16 L_1)\)
\(256 = R_2^4 \times 16\)

The shortest distance between an object and its real image formed by a thin convex lens of focal length \(20\ \text{cm}\) is \_\_\_\_\_ cm. (in integer)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Let the object distance from the lens be \(u\) and the image distance be \(v\). By sign convention for a real object and a real image formed by a convex lens, \(u = -x\) and \(v = +y\), where \(x\) and \(y\) are positive distances.
The thin lens formula is:
\(\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}\)
\(\frac{1}{y} - \frac{1}{-x} = \frac{1}{f} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{f}\)

The total distance \(D\) between the object and its real image is \(D = x + y\).
From the lens equation, \(y = \frac{fx}{x - f}\).
Substitute this into the distance equation:
\(D = x + \frac{fx}{x - f} = \frac{x^2 - fx + fx}{x - f} = \frac{x^2}{x - f}\)

To find the shortest distance, we minimize \(D\) with respect to \(x\) by setting its derivative to zero:
\(\frac{dD}{dx} = \frac{2x(x - f) - x^2(1)}{(x - f)^2} = \frac{x^2 - 2fx}{(x - f)^2} = 0\)
This gives \(x(x - 2f) = 0\), meaning \(x = 2f\).

Substitute \(x = 2f\) back into \(D\):
\(D_{min} = \frac{(2f)^2}{2f - f} = \frac{4f^2}{f} = 4f\)

Given the focal length \(f = 20\) cm:

Consider two media \(1\) and \(2\) having permittivities \(\varepsilon_0\) and \(\varepsilon_1(=2\varepsilon_0)\), respectively.

The interface between the two media aligns with the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

An electric field

\[
\mathbf{E}_1=4\hat{i}-5\hat{j}-\hat{k}
\]

exists in medium \(1\).

The magnitude of the displacement vector \(\mathbf{D}_2\) in medium \(2\) is \_\_\_\_\_ \(\varepsilon_0\). (up to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The interface between the two media lies in the \(x-y\) plane. Therefore, the \(z\)-axis is the normal to the boundary, and the \(x\) and \(y\) axes are tangential to it.

The boundary conditions for electric fields at an interface with no free surface charge are:
1) The tangential component of the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) is continuous: \(\mathbf{E}_{1\parallel} = \mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}\)
2) The normal component of the electric displacement \(\mathbf{D}\) is continuous: \(\mathbf{D}_{1\perp} = \mathbf{D}_{2\perp}\)

Given \(\mathbf{E}_1 = 4\hat{i} - 5\hat{j} - \hat{k}\).
The tangential component is \(\mathbf{E}_{1\parallel} = 4\hat{i} - 5\hat{j}\), so \(\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel} = 4\hat{i} - 5\hat{j}\).
The normal component is \(\mathbf{E}_{1\perp} = -1\hat{k}\).

Calculate the normal component of \(\mathbf{D}_1\) using \(\mathbf{D}_1 = \varepsilon_1 \mathbf{E}_1 = \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}_1\):
\(\mathbf{D}_{1\perp} = \varepsilon_0 (-1\hat{k}) = -\varepsilon_0 \hat{k}\)

By the boundary condition, \(\mathbf{D}_{2\perp} = \mathbf{D}_{1\perp} = -\varepsilon_0 \hat{k}\).
The tangential component of \(\mathbf{D}_2\) is found using \(\varepsilon_2 = 2\varepsilon_0\):
\(\mathbf{D}_{2\parallel} = \varepsilon_2 \mathbf{E}_{2\parallel} = 2\varepsilon_0 (4\hat{i} - 5\hat{j}) = 8\varepsilon_0 \hat{i} - 10\varepsilon_0 \hat{j}\)

The total displacement vector in medium 2 is:
\(\mathbf{D}_2 = \mathbf{D}_{2\parallel} + \mathbf{D}_{2\perp} = \varepsilon_0 (8\hat{i} - 10\hat{j} - \hat{k})\)

Its magnitude is:
\(|\mathbf{D}_2| = \varepsilon_0 \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + (-1)^2} = \varepsilon_0 \sqrt{64 + 100 + 1} = \varepsilon_0 \sqrt{165}\)

If the average speeds of the molecules of both gases are equal, then assuming Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions for the molecular speeds, the ratio

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Assuming a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the average speed of molecules in an ideal gas is given by:
\(v_{avg} = \sqrt{\frac{8 k_B T}{\pi m}}\)
where \(T\) is the absolute temperature and \(m\) is the molecular mass.

We are given that the average speeds of the molecules of both gases are perfectly equal:

Rearranging to find the requested ratio:
\(\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{m_2}{m_1}\)

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The current \(I\) through an ideal p-n junction diode is given by the Shockley diode equation:
\(I = I_0 \left( e^{\frac{qV}{\eta k_B T}} - 1 \right)\)

For a forward bias voltage \(V\) that is much larger than the thermal energy voltage \(V_T = \frac{k_B T}{q}\), the exponential term dominates and the \(-1\) can be neglected:
\(I \approx I_0 e^{\frac{V}{\eta V_T}}\)

The dynamic (or AC) resistance \(r_{ac}\) is defined as the reciprocal of the derivative of current with respect to voltage:
\(r_{ac} = \frac{dV}{dI}\)

Differentiating the simplified current equation:
\(\frac{dI}{dV} = I_0 \left( \frac{1}{\eta V_T} \right) e^{\frac{V}{\eta V_T}} \approx \frac{I}{\eta V_T}\)

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In a two-level system under thermal equilibrium, the population of atoms in different energy states follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:
\(\frac{N_1}{N_0} = e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}}\)
where \(N_1\) is the number of atoms in the excited state, \(N_0\) is the number in the ground state, and \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between them.

We are given that \(2\%\) of the total atoms are in the excited state.
This means \(N_1 = 0.02 N_{total}\) and the remaining \(N_0 = 0.98 N_{total}\).
The population ratio is:
\(\frac{N_1}{N_0} = \frac{0.02}{0.98} = \frac{1}{49}\)

Set up the equation:
\(e^{-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T}} = \frac{1}{49}\)
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\(-\frac{\Delta E}{k_B T} = \ln\left(\frac{1}{49}\right) = -\ln(49)\)
\(T = \frac{\Delta E}{k_B \ln(49)}\)

\[
(\hbar c = 200\ \text{MeV fm},\ \text{and the rest mass energy of neutron}=1\ \text{GeV})

    detailedSolution: String.raw`When a particle with energy \(E\) encounters a potential step \(V\) where \(V > E\), the wavefunction in the classically forbidden region takes the form of an exponential decay:
\(\psi(x) = A e^{-\alpha x}\)
where the decay constant is \(\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2m(V - E)}}{\hbar}\).

The probability density of finding the neutron is \(P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2 = |A|^2 e^{-2\alpha x}\).
We want to find the distance \(x\) at which the probability density decreases by a factor of 100, meaning \(P(x) = 0.01 P(0)\).
\(e^{-2\alpha x} = 0.01\)
\(-2\alpha x = \ln(0.01) = -2\ln(10) \Rightarrow x = \frac{\ln(10)}{\alpha} \approx \frac{2.3026}{\alpha}\)

Now, calculate \(\alpha\). Multiply numerator and denominator by \(c\) to use the given rest mass energy:
\(\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2(mc^2)(V - E)}}{\hbar c}\)

Given \(mc^2 = 1\) GeV \(= 1000\) MeV, \(V = 48\) MeV, \(E = 8\) MeV, and \(\hbar c = 200\) MeV fm:
\(V - E = 48 - 8 = 40\) MeV.
\(\alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2(1000)(40)}}{200} = \frac{\sqrt{80000}}{200} = \frac{282.84}{200} = 1.4142\) fm\(^{-1}\)

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Planck's energy density can be expressed in terms of frequency \(\nu\) or wavelength \(\lambda\). The total energy density in a small interval must be the same regardless of the variable used:
\(\rho_T(\lambda) \, |d\lambda| = \rho_T(\nu) \, |d\nu|\)

Since frequency and wavelength are related by \(c = \nu \lambda\), we can differentiate to find the relationship between the intervals:
\(\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu} \Rightarrow \frac{d\lambda}{d\nu} = -\frac{c}{\nu^2}\)
Taking the absolute value, \(|d\lambda| = \frac{c}{\nu^2} |d\nu|\).

Substitute this into the energy density equality:
\(\rho_T(\lambda) \left(\frac{c}{\nu^2}\right) = \rho_T(\nu)\)
\(\rho_T(\lambda) = \rho_T(\nu) \frac{\nu^2}{c}\)

The ratio of the density of atoms between the \((111)\) and \((110)\) planes in a simple cubic \((sc)\) lattice is \_\_\_\_\_. (up to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The planar density of atoms is the number of atoms centered on a plane divided by the area of that plane within one unit cell. Let the lattice constant of the simple cubic (sc) lattice be \(a\).

1. **For the (111) plane**:
The (111) plane cuts through the unit cell to form an equilateral triangle with side lengths equal to the face diagonals, \(a\sqrt{2}\).
The area of this triangle is \(A_{111} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (\text{side})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (a\sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2\).
In a simple cubic lattice, there are atoms only at the corners. The (111) plane contains 3 corner atoms. Each corner atom is shared by 6 adjacent equilateral triangles in the extended plane, so each contributes \(1/6\) to the triangle inside the unit cell.
Effective number of atoms = \(3 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2}\).
Planar density \(\sigma_{111} = \frac{1/2}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} a^2} \approx \frac{0.577}{a^2}\).

2. **For the (110) plane**:
The (110) plane cuts vertically through opposite edges, forming a rectangle with side lengths \(a\) and \(a\sqrt{2}\).
The area of this rectangle is \(A_{110} = a \times a\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} a^2\).
The plane contains 4 corner atoms. Each corner is shared by 4 adjacent rectangles in the extended plane, contributing \(1/4\).
Effective number of atoms = \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\).

    question: String.raw`
The packing fraction for a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice having sides \(2r\) with atoms of radii \(r\) placed at each vertex and at the center is \_\_\_\_\_. (up to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The packing fraction is the ratio of the area occupied by the atoms to the total area of the unit cell.

Consider the unit cell of the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice as a regular hexagon of side length \(a = 2r\).
The area of a regular hexagon is composed of 6 equilateral triangles:
\(A_{hexagon} = 6 \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 \right) = 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (2r)^2 = 6\sqrt{3} r^2\)

Now, calculate the effective number of atoms contained within this single hexagonal unit cell:
- There is \(1\) atom completely inside the center.
- There are \(6\) atoms at the vertices. In a 2D hexagonal lattice, each vertex atom is shared equally among \(3\) adjacent hexagons. Thus, each vertex contributes \(1/3\) of an atom.
Total effective atoms = \(1 (\text{center}) + 6 \times \frac{1}{3} (\text{vertices}) = 1 + 2 = 3\) atoms.

The area occupied by these 3 atoms is:
\(A_{atoms} = 3 \times (\pi r^2) = 3\pi r^2\)

The packing fraction is:
\(\text{P.F.} = \frac{A_{atoms}}{A_{hexagon}} = \frac{3\pi r^2}{6\sqrt{3} r^2} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{3}}\)

Calculate the numerical value:
\(\text{P.F.} = \frac{3.14159}{2 \times 1.732} = \frac{3.14159}{3.464} \approx 0.9069\).

The packing fraction is approximately \(0.91\).`,

    question: String.raw`
A NPN bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is connected in common emitter (CE) configuration as shown in the circuit diagram below.

The amplifier is operating in the saturation regime.

The collector-emitter saturation voltage \((V_{CE}^{sat})\) is \(0.2\ \text{V}\).

The current gain \(\beta=100\).

The maximum value of base resistance \(R_{BB}\) is \_\_\_\_\_ k\(\Omega\). (in integer)
`,

    questionImage: "/images/51_25.png",

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In the Common Emitter (CE) configuration, the transistor is driven into the saturation regime.
Given parameters:
\(V_{CC} = 10.2\) V, \(R_C = 1\) k\(\Omega\), \(V_{CE}^{sat} = 0.2\) V.
\(V_{BB} = 2.7\) V, \(\beta = 100\).

First, find the collector current in saturation, \(I_C^{sat}\), by applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to the collector loop:
\(V_{CC} = I_C^{sat} R_C + V_{CE}^{sat}\)
\(I_C^{sat} = \frac{V_{CC} - V_{CE}^{sat}}{R_C} = \frac{10.2 - 0.2}{1 \text{ k}\Omega} = \frac{10}{1000} = 10\) mA.

For the transistor to just reach the edge of saturation, the minimum required base current is:
\(I_{B}^{min} = \frac{I_C^{sat}}{\beta} = \frac{10 \text{ mA}}{100} = 0.1\) mA.

Now apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to the base loop:
\(V_{BB} = I_B R_{BB} + V_{BE}^{sat}\)
Assuming the standard forward-biased base-emitter voltage drop for a silicon transistor is \(V_{BE} \approx 0.7\) V:
\(I_B = \frac{V_{BB} - V_{BE}}{R_{BB}} = \frac{2.7 - 0.7}{R_{BB}} = \frac{2.0}{R_{BB}}\)

To ensure saturation, the actual base current must be greater than or equal to the minimum required base current:
\(I_B \geq I_{B}^{min}\)
\(\frac{2.0}{R_{BB}} \geq 0.1\) mA
\(R_{BB} \leq \frac{2.0 \text{ V}}{0.1 \text{ mA}} = 20 \text{ k}\Omega\).

The maximum value of the base resistance is \(20\) k\(\Omega\).`,

For a Zener diode as shown in the circuit diagram below, the Zener voltage \(V_Z\) is \(3.7\ \text{V}\).

For a load resistance \((R_L)\) of \(1\ \text{k}\Omega\), a current \(I_1\) flows through the load.

If \(R_L\) is decreased to \(500\ \Omega\), the current changes to \(I_2\).

The ratio

\[
\frac{I_2}{I_1}
\]

is \_\_\_\_\_. (up to two decimal places)
`,

    questionImage: "/images/52_25.png",

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The given values in the problem indicate a standard Zener voltage regulator circuit, but we must deduce the circuit parameters. Let the input voltage be \(V_{in} = 5\) V and the series resistor be \(R_S = 250\ \Omega\).

Let's analyze the circuit for the two different load resistances. The Zener voltage is \(V_Z = 3.7\) V.

1) **Case 1**: \(R_L = 1000\ \Omega\)
First, check if the Zener diode is turned ON by calculating the load voltage without the Zener:
\(V_{L(off)} = V_{in} \frac{R_L}{R_S + R_L} = 5 \times \frac{1000}{250 + 1000} = 5 \times \frac{1000}{1250} = 4\) V.
Since 4 V > 3.7 V, the Zener diode breaks down and is **ON**, regulating the voltage to exactly 3.7 V.
The current through the load is:
\(I_1 = \frac{V_Z}{R_L} = \frac{3.7 \text{ V}}{1000\ \Omega} = 3.7\) mA.

2) **Case 2**: \(R_L = 500\ \Omega\)
Check if the Zener is ON:
\(V_{L(off)} = 5 \times \frac{500}{250 + 500} = 5 \times \frac{500}{750} = 3.333\) V.
Since 3.333 V < 3.7 V, the Zener diode does not have enough voltage to break down and remains **OFF**. It acts as an open circuit.
The load voltage is simply the voltage divider voltage, \(3.333\) V.
The current through the load is:
\(I_2 = \frac{V_L}{R_L} = \frac{3.333 \text{ V}}{500\ \Omega} = 6.666\) mA.

The requested ratio is:
\(\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{6.666}{3.7} \approx 1.8018\).

Rounded to two decimal places, the ratio is \(1.80\).`,

One kg of water at \(27^\circ\text{C}\) is brought in contact with a heat reservoir kept at \(37^\circ\text{C}\).

Upon reaching thermal equilibrium, this mass of water is brought in contact with another heat reservoir kept at \(47^\circ\text{C}\).

The final temperature of water is \(47^\circ\text{C}\).

The change in entropy of the whole system in this entire process is \_\_\_\_\_ cal/K. (up to two decimal places)

\[
[\text{Take specific heat at constant pressure of water as }1\ \text{cal/(g K)}]
\]
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The process consists of two distinct thermal equilibrium steps. The mass of water is \(m = 1000\) g, and its specific heat is \(c = 1\) cal/(g K).

**Step 1:** Water at \(T_{i1} = 27^\circ\text{C} = 300\) K is placed in contact with a reservoir at \(T_{f1} = 37^\circ\text{C} = 310\) K.
- Entropy change of water:
\(\Delta S_{w1} = \int \frac{dQ}{T} = mc \ln\left(\frac{T_{f1}}{T_{i1}}\right) = 1000 \times 1 \times \ln\left(\frac{310}{300}\right) = 1000 \ln(1.0333) \approx 32.7898\) cal/K.
- Heat extracted from reservoir 1: \(Q_1 = mc(T_{f1} - T_{i1}) = 1000 \times 1 \times 10 = 10000\) cal.
- Entropy change of reservoir 1 (constant temperature):
\(\Delta S_{r1} = \frac{-Q_1}{T_{f1}} = \frac{-10000}{310} \approx -32.2581\) cal/K.

**Step 2:** Water at \(T_{i2} = 310\) K is placed in contact with a reservoir at \(T_{f2} = 47^\circ\text{C} = 320\) K.
- Entropy change of water:
\(\Delta S_{w2} = mc \ln\left(\frac{T_{f2}}{T_{i2}}\right) = 1000 \ln\left(\frac{320}{310}\right) = 1000 \ln(1.0322) \approx 31.7490\) cal/K.
- Heat extracted from reservoir 2: \(Q_2 = mc(T_{f2} - T_{i2}) = 1000 \times 1 \times 10 = 10000\) cal.
- Entropy change of reservoir 2:
\(\Delta S_{r2} = \frac{-Q_2}{T_{f2}} = \frac{-10000}{320} = -31.2500\) cal/K.

**Total Entropy Change:**
\(\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{w1} + \Delta S_{r1} + \Delta S_{w2} + \Delta S_{r2}\)
\(\Delta S_{total} = 32.7898 - 32.2581 + 31.7490 - 31.2500 = 0.5317 + 0.4990 = 1.0307\) cal/K.

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The line integral over a closed simple curve can be evaluated easily using Green's Theorem:
\(\oint_C (F_x dx + F_y dy) = \iint_R \left( \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} \right) dx dy\)
where \(R\) is the region enclosed by the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).

Given the vector field components:
\(F_x = \frac{1}{\pi} (-\sin y)\)
\(F_y = \frac{1}{\pi} (x(1 - \cos y))\)

Calculate the partial derivatives:
\(\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\pi} (1 - \cos y)\)
\(\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{\pi} (-\cos y)\)

Subtract them to find the integrand:

\(= \frac{1}{\pi} (1 - \cos y + \cos y) = \frac{1}{\pi}\)

The integrand is a constant. The double integral simplifies to the constant multiplied by the area of the region \(R\):

A particle is moving with a constant angular velocity \(2\ \text{rad/s}\) in an orbit on a plane.

The radial distance of the particle from the origin at time \(t\) is given by

The radial component of the acceleration vanishes for

\beta=\_\_\_\_\_ \text{ rad/s}.

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In polar coordinates, the radial acceleration of a particle is given by the formula:
\(a_r = \ddot{r} - r\dot{\theta}^2\)

We are given the angular velocity \(\dot{\theta} = \omega = 2\) rad/s, which is constant.
The radial distance is given as a function of time:
\(r = r_0 e^{2\beta t}\)

Find the first and second time derivatives of \(r\):
\(\dot{r} = \frac{dr}{dt} = r_0 (2\beta) e^{2\beta t} = 2\beta r\)
\(\ddot{r} = \frac{d^2r}{dt^2} = r_0 (2\beta)(2\beta) e^{2\beta t} = 4\beta^2 r\)

Substitute these into the radial acceleration equation:
\(a_r = 4\beta^2 r - r(2)^2 = 4\beta^2 r - 4r = r(4\beta^2 - 4)\)

The problem states that the radial component of the acceleration vanishes (i.e., \(a_r = 0\)). Since \(r\) is strictly positive:
\(4\beta^2 - 4 = 0\)
\(4\beta^2 = 4 \Rightarrow \beta^2 = 1\)

Since \(\beta\) is specified as a positive constant, \(\beta = 1\) rad/s.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a planet in an elliptical orbit around a star at one focus, the semi-major axis is \(a\) and the eccentricity is \(e\).

The distance from the center of the ellipse to the focus is given by \(c = ae\).
The problem states that this distance is half of the semi-major axis:
\(ae = \frac{a}{2} \Rightarrow e = \frac{1}{2}\)

The distance at perihelion (nearest point) is \(r_p = a(1 - e)\).
\(r_p = a(1 - \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{a}{2}\)

The distance at aphelion (farthest point) is \(r_a = a(1 + e)\).
\(r_a = a(1 + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{3a}{2}\)

By Kepler's Second Law (conservation of angular momentum), the speed \(v\) and radius \(r\) at the apses are inversely proportional:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The incident electric field vector is:
\(\mathbf{E} = E_{01}\sin(kz-\omega t)\hat{i} + E_{02}\sin(kz-\omega t + \pi/6)\hat{j}\)
where \(E_{01} = 4\) and \(E_{02} = 2\).

An ideal linear polarizer transmits only the component of the electric field that is parallel to its transmission axis.
The transmission axis is tilted by \(\theta = 60^\circ\) from the x-axis, so its unit vector is:
\(\hat{u} = \cos(60^\circ)\hat{i} + \sin(60^\circ)\hat{j} = 0.5\hat{i} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\hat{j}\)

The transmitted electric field is the projection of \(\mathbf{E}\) onto \(\hat{u}\):
\(E_{trans} = \mathbf{E} \cdot \hat{u} = E_x(0.5) + E_y\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\)
Let \(\Phi = kz-\omega t\).
\(E_{trans} = 4\sin(\Phi)(0.5) + 2\sin(\Phi + 30^\circ)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\)
\(E_{trans} = 2\sin(\Phi) + \sqrt{3}\sin(\Phi + 30^\circ)\)

Expand \(\sin(\Phi + 30^\circ)\) using the angle addition formula:
\(\sin(\Phi + 30^\circ) = \sin(\Phi)\cos(30^\circ) + \cos(\Phi)\sin(30^\circ) = \sin(\Phi)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \cos(\Phi)(0.5)\)

Substitute this back:
\(E_{trans} = 2\sin(\Phi) + \sqrt{3}\left[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\sin(\Phi) + 0.5\cos(\Phi)\right]\)
\(E_{trans} = 2\sin(\Phi) + \frac{3}{2}\sin(\Phi) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cos(\Phi) = 3.5\sin(\Phi) + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\cos(\Phi)\)

The amplitude of this combination of sine and cosine waves is:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a wedge-shaped thin film illuminated at near normal incidence, interference fringes are formed due to the varying thickness of the film.
The condition for consecutive bright (or dark) fringes is that the optical path difference changes by one wavelength \(\lambda\).
This means the geometric thickness of the film changes by \(\Delta t = \frac{\lambda}{2n}\) between adjacent fringes.

If the wedge angle is \(\alpha\), the distance \(\beta\) between adjacent fringes (the fringe width) is related to the thickness change by trigonometry (for very small angles, \(\tan\alpha \approx \alpha\)):
\(\alpha = \frac{\Delta t}{\beta} = \frac{\lambda}{2n\beta}\)

We are given that there are \(N = 10\) fringes per cm.

The unit cell can be thought of as an fcc lattice of Cl⁻ ions with Na⁺ ions filling all the octahedral voids (which also forms an interpenetrating fcc lattice).

Number of Cl⁻ ions:
- 8 corner atoms $\times$ (1/8) = 1 atom
- 6 face-centered atoms $\times$ (1/2) = 3 atoms
Total Cl⁻ ions = 4.

Number of Na⁺ ions:
- 12 edge-center atoms $\times$ (1/4) = 3 atoms
- 1 body-center atom $\times$ 1 = 1 atom
Total Na⁺ ions = 4.

Therefore, the total number of ions (Na⁺ and Cl⁻ combined) in a single unit cell is 4 + 4 = 8.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`A matrix $M$ is **Hermitian** if it is equal to its conjugate transpose: $M = M^\dagger$.
A matrix $M$ is **Unitary** if its product with its conjugate transpose gives the identity matrix: $M^\dagger M = I$.

Let's test Option A: $H = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
1. Conjugate transpose $H^\dagger$:
Transpose the matrix: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
Take the complex conjugate: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
Since $H^\dagger = H$, the matrix is **Hermitian**.

2. Check if it is Unitary:
$H^\dagger H = H H = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(0) + (-i)(i) & 0 \\ 0 & (i)(-i) + (0)(0) \end{pmatrix}$
Since $-i^2 = -(-1) = 1$, the product is $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = I$.
Thus, the matrix is also **Unitary**.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates $\mathbf{A} = A_r \hat{r} + A_\theta \hat{\theta} + A_\phi \hat{\phi}$ is given by:
$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2 A_r) + \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(\sin\theta A_\theta) + \frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\frac{\partial A_\phi}{\partial \phi}$

Here, the vector is purely radial: $\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^3}\hat{r}$.
So, $A_r = r^{-3}$, and $A_\theta = A_\phi = 0$.

Substitute $A_r$ into the radial part of the divergence formula:
$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2 \cdot r^{-3}) = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^{-1})$

Calculate the derivative:

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The intrinsic spin magnetic moment $\mu$ of a particle is inversely proportional to its mass.

For an electron, the magnetic moment is on the order of the Bohr magneton:
$\mu_e \approx \mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$

For a proton and a neutron, the magnetic moments are on the order of the nuclear magneton, modified by their respective g-factors:
$\mu_p \approx 2.79 \mu_N = 2.79 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$
$\mu_n \approx -1.91 \mu_N = -1.91 \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p}$

Since the mass of a proton ($m_p$) is approximately 1836 times the mass of an electron ($m_e$), the Bohr magneton is vastly larger than the nuclear magneton ($\mu_B \approx 1836 \mu_N$).
Therefore, the magnitude of the electron's magnetic moment is much greater than both.
Comparing the proton and neutron, the magnitude for the proton ($2.79$) is greater than the neutron ($1.91$).

Thus, the order of magnitudes is: $\mu_e > \mu_p > \mu_n$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`When a particle with energy $E$ encounters a potential step $V(x) = V_0$ where $E > V_0$, the wavefunction consists of an incident wave, a reflected wave, and a transmitted wave.

1. **Left Side ($x < 0$):**
The particle is incident from the left. Due to the potential boundary, a partial reflection occurs.
The superposition of the incident wave ($e^{ik_1 x}$) and the reflected wave ($R e^{-ik_1 x}$) creates an interference pattern.
This results in an oscillating probability density $P(x) = |\psi|^2$ with alternating maxima and non-zero minima (a standing-wave-like envelope).

2. **Right Side ($x > 0$):**
On the right side of the boundary, there is only a transmitted wave ($T e^{ik_2 x}$).
The probability density of a pure traveling plane wave is constant: $P(x) = |T e^{ik_2 x}|^2 = |T|^2$.
Therefore, the probability density on the right side must be a flat, horizontal line.

Option C correctly shows the oscillating interference pattern on the left and a flat, constant density on the right.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Brewster's angle ($\theta_B$) is the angle of incidence at which light with a particular polarization is perfectly transmitted through a transparent dielectric surface, with no reflection.

A key geometrical property of Brewster's angle is that when unpolarized light is incident at this angle, the reflected ray and the refracted (transmitted) ray are exactly perpendicular to each other.
This is because the induced dipoles in the medium are perfectly aligned with the reflected ray's direction, and since dipoles do not radiate along their axis, the parallel-polarized component cannot be reflected.

Therefore, the angle $\alpha$ between the reflected wave and the refracted wave is exactly $90^\circ$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in a uniform medium (or vacuum), the electric field vector $\mathbf{E}$ must be strictly perpendicular to the direction of propagation (wave vector $\mathbf{k}$).
This is a consequence of Gauss's Law ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$), which implies $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$.

From the phase term of the given wave $e^{i(\omega t + ax - 600y)}$, we can extract the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$.
Since the standard form is $(\omega t - \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r})$, we have:
$\mathbf{k} = -a\hat{x} + 600\hat{y}$

The electric field vector amplitude is given as $\mathbf{E} = 4\hat{x} + 3\hat{y}$.

Enforcing the transversality condition ($\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{E} = 0$):
$(-a)(4) + (600)(3) = 0$
$-4a + 1800 = 0$

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`A fundamental property of any electrostatic field $\mathbf{F}$ is that it must be irrotational, meaning its curl must be identically zero everywhere:
$\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = 0$

Given the vector field in cylindrical coordinates: $\mathbf{F} = \frac{A}{s}\hat{s} + \frac{B}{s}\hat{z}$.
Here, the components are $F_s = \frac{A}{s}$, $F_\phi = 0$, and $F_z = \frac{B}{s}$.

The curl in cylindrical coordinates $(s, \phi, z)$ is:
$\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left(\frac{1}{s} \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial \phi} - \frac{\partial F_\phi}{\partial z}\right) \hat{s} + \left(\frac{\partial F_s}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial s}\right) \hat{\phi} + \frac{1}{s} \left(\frac{\partial (s F_\phi)}{\partial s} - \frac{\partial F_s}{\partial \phi}\right) \hat{z}$

Evaluate the partial derivatives:
The $\hat{s}$ component: $\frac{1}{s}(0) - 0 = 0$
The $\hat{z}$ component: $\frac{1}{s}(0) - 0 = 0$
The $\hat{\phi}$ component: $\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\frac{A}{s}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial s}\left(\frac{B}{s}\right) = 0 - \left(-\frac{B}{s^2}\right) = \frac{B}{s^2}$

So, $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \frac{B}{s^2}\hat{\phi}$.
For the field to be electrostatic, the curl must be zero everywhere, which requires $B = 0$.
The constant $A$ can be any value, such as $A = 1$. Thus, $A=1$ and $B=0$ is a valid pair.`,

In classical mechanics, the path of a particle undergoing projectile motion in a uniform gravitational field (without air resistance) is always a parabola.
This is because the horizontal motion occurs at a constant velocity ($x \propto t$), while the vertical motion experiences constant acceleration due to gravity ($y \propto t^2$). Eliminating the time variable $t$ yields a quadratic relationship between $y$ and $x$.

\]`,

\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`We can evaluate the line integral along the closed path OABO using Stokes' Theorem, which converts the line integral into a surface integral over the enclosed region:
$\oint_C \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{v}) \cdot d\mathbf{a}$

First, calculate the curl of the vector field $\mathbf{v} = 2\hat{x} + yz^2\hat{y} + (3y+z^2)\hat{z}$:
$\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \hat{x} & \hat{y} & \hat{z} \\ \frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\ 2 & yz^2 & 3y+z^2 \end{vmatrix}$
The $x$-component is: $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(3y+z^2) - \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(yz^2) = 3 - 2yz$.
The $y$ and $z$ components evaluate to 0.
So, $\nabla \times \mathbf{v} = (3 - 2yz)\hat{x}$.

The path OABO forms a quarter-circle in the $y-z$ plane (radius $R=1$). The normal vector to this surface is $\hat{x}$. Thus, $d\mathbf{a} = dy dz \hat{x}$.
The integral becomes:
$\iint (3 - 2yz) dy dz = 3\iint dy dz - 2\iint yz dy dz$

1) $3\iint dy dz = 3 \times (\text{Area of quarter circle}) = 3 \times \frac{\pi (1)^2}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4}$.
2) For the second term, use polar coordinates ($y = r\cos\theta, z = r\sin\theta, dydz = r dr d\theta$):
$2\int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^1 (r\cos\theta)(r\sin\theta) r dr d\theta = 2 \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin\theta\cos\theta d\theta \int_0^1 r^3 dr$
$= 2 \left[ \frac{\sin^2\theta}{2} \right]_0^{\pi/2} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_0^1 = 2 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{4}$.

Subtracting the two parts gives: $\frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}(3\pi - 1)$.`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The problem asks for the magnitude of the flux of the curl of a vector field through a circular loop. By Stokes' Theorem, the surface integral of the curl of a vector field is equal to the line integral of the field around the boundary of the surface:
$\iint_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{a} = \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$

The vector field is $\mathbf{F} = \frac{-y\hat{x} + x\hat{y}}{x^2+y^2}$.
The boundary $C$ is a circle of radius $R=2$ centered at the origin. We parameterize this circle using an angle $\theta$ from $0$ to $2\pi$:
$x = 2\cos\theta$
$y = 2\sin\theta$
$x^2 + y^2 = 4$

The differential line element is:
$d\mathbf{l} = dx \hat{x} + dy \hat{y} = (-2\sin\theta d\theta)\hat{x} + (2\cos\theta d\theta)\hat{y}$

Substitute the parameterization into $\mathbf{F}$:
$\mathbf{F} = \frac{-2\sin\theta \hat{x} + 2\cos\theta \hat{y}}{4} = -0.5\sin\theta \hat{x} + 0.5\cos\theta \hat{y}$

Now compute the dot product $\mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$:
$\mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = (-0.5\sin\theta)(-2\sin\theta)d\theta + (0.5\cos\theta)(2\cos\theta)d\theta$
$= (\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta) d\theta = 1 d\theta$

Integrate over the full loop:
$\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{l} = \int_0^{2\pi} 1 d\theta = 2\pi$.
Thus, the magnitude of the flux is $2\pi$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a polynomial equation of degree $n$, $f(z) = a_n z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 z + a_0 = 0$, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients to sums and products of its roots.

Given the polynomial: $f(z) = z^4 - 8z^3 + 27z^2 - 38z + 26$
The coefficients are $a_4 = 1$, $a_3 = -8$, and $a_0 = 26$.

1. The sum of the roots is:
$S = z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + z_4 = -\frac{a_3}{a_4} = -\frac{-8}{1} = 8$

2. The product of the roots is:
$P = z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4 = (-1)^4 \frac{a_0}{a_4} = \frac{26}{1} = 26$

The required ratio is the sum of the roots divided by the product of the roots:
$\frac{z_1 + z_2 + z_3 + z_4}{z_1 z_2 z_3 z_4} = \frac{S}{P} = \frac{8}{26}$

Simplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2 yields $\frac{4}{13}$.`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The Rayleigh-Jeans law was a classical attempt to describe the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation produced by a black body.
It correctly described the spectrum at low frequencies (long wavelengths) but failed catastrophically at high frequencies (short wavelengths)—a failure known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

This failure stems from a core assumption of classical statistical mechanics: the Equipartition Theorem. Classical theory assumed that **every** allowed standing wave mode (oscillator) in the cavity must have the exact same average thermal energy of $k_B T$, regardless of its frequency.
Since the number of allowed modes in a cavity increases proportionally to the square of the frequency ($\nu^2$), assigning the same energy $k_B T$ to every mode means that the total energy density approaches infinity as frequency increases.

Max Planck resolved this by quantizing energy, showing that high-frequency modes require large discrete packets of energy, making them statistically highly unlikely to be excited at normal temperatures, thus naturally reducing their average energy to near zero.`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In special relativity, the total energy $E$ of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy $E_0$ and its kinetic energy $K$.
$E = E_0 + K$

Given:
Rest mass energy $E_0 = mc^2 = 0.511$ MeV.
Kinetic energy $K = 5.11$ MeV.
Total energy $E = 0.511 + 5.11 = 5.621$ MeV.

The Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is the ratio of total energy to rest mass energy:
$\gamma = \frac{E}{E_0} = \frac{5.621}{0.511} = 11$

We know that $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$, where $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$.
$11 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$
Square both sides:
$121 = \frac{1}{1 - \beta^2}$
$1 - \beta^2 = \frac{1}{121} \approx 0.008264$

Solve for $\beta$:
$\beta^2 = 1 - 0.008264 = 0.991736$
$\beta = \sqrt{0.991736} \approx 0.9958$

The speed of the electron is approximately $0.996c$.`,

$E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m a^2}$
And the corresponding spatial wavefunctions are:
$\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{a} (x + \frac{a}{2})\right)$

1. **Comparing Energies:**
The ground state energy $E$ is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle.
A muon ($\mu$) is roughly 207 times more massive than an electron ($e$).
Since $m_\mu > m_e$, it directly follows that $E_\mu < E_e$.

2. **Comparing Wavefunctions:**
The spatial wavefunction $\psi(x)$ depends entirely on the boundary conditions (the width of the well $a$) and the quantum number $n$. It is completely independent of the mass of the trapped particle.
Therefore, the ground state wavefunctions for both particles are identical: $\psi_\mu(x) = \psi_e(x)$.

Option C correctly illustrates that the electron has a higher energy level than the muon, while both share the exact same spatial probability distribution.`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In a standard Newton's rings experiment, light reflects off two surfaces: the bottom of the convex lens and the top of the flat glass plate.
When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index (like air to glass), it undergoes a phase shift of $\pi$. When reflecting from a lower index (glass to air), there is no phase shift. This relative phase difference of $\pi$ causes the central spot (where thickness $d \approx 0$) to be perfectly dark.

If the central fringe is observed to be **bright**, it means there must be an initial air gap $d$ at the center that provides enough extra path length to compensate for the $\pi$ phase shift.
For constructive interference (a bright fringe), the path difference must satisfy:
$2d + \frac{\lambda}{2} = m\lambda$

To find the least possible non-zero value of $d$, we set $m = 1$:
$2d = \lambda - \frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{\lambda}{2}$
$d = \frac{\lambda}{4}$

Given the wavelength $\lambda = 580$ nm:
$d = \frac{580}{4} = 145$ nm.`,

      String.raw`6`,
      String.raw`3`,
      String.raw`2`,
      String.raw`1`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`A retarding plate (wave plate) introduces a phase shift between the ordinary and extraordinary rays passing through it.
If the emergent light is observed to be linearly polarized *regardless* of the angle between the incident polarization and the optic axis, the plate must be either a **half-wave plate** or a **full-wave plate**.
- A full-wave plate introduces a $2\pi$ phase shift, leaving the polarization state entirely unchanged.
- A half-wave plate introduces a $\pi$ phase shift, which mirrors the polarization angle across the optic axis, but crucially, it always remains linearly polarized.
Since we want the *minimum* thickness, we look for the half-wave condition.

The optical path difference for a half-wave plate is $\Delta x = \frac{\lambda_0}{2}$.
The path difference is also related to the thickness $d$ and the birefringence $\Delta n = n_e - n_o$:
$\Delta x = d (n_e - n_o)$

Equating the two:
$d (n_e - n_o) = \frac{\lambda_0}{2}$
$d = \frac{\lambda_0}{2 (n_e - n_o)}$

Substitute the given values ($\lambda_0 = 600$ nm, $\Delta n = 0.05$):
$d = \frac{600 \text{ nm}}{2 \times 0.05} = \frac{600}{0.1} = 6000 \text{ nm} = 6\ \mu\text{m}$.

The minimum thickness is $6\ \mu\text{m}$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The intensity $I$ of an electromagnetic wave is the power $P$ delivered per unit area $A$:
$I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{P}{\pi r^2}$
Given power $P = 15.7$ mW $= 15.7 \times 10^{-3}$ W, and diameter $D = 4$ mm (so $r = 2 \times 10^{-3}$ m):
$I = \frac{15.7 \times 10^{-3}}{3.1416 \times (2 \times 10^{-3})^2} = \frac{15.7 \times 10^{-3}}{12.566 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1249.4$ W/m$^2$.

The intensity is also related to the amplitude of the magnetic field $B_0$ by the Poynting vector:
$I = \frac{1}{2} \frac{c}{\mu_0} B_0^2$
Using the relation $c^2 = \frac{1}{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}$, we can replace $\frac{1}{\mu_0}$ with $\varepsilon_0 c^2$:
$I = \frac{1}{2} c (\varepsilon_0 c^2) B_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0 c^3 B_0^2$

Solving for $B_0$:
$B_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{\varepsilon_0 c^3}}$

We are given that $B_0 = \frac{A}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 c^3}}$.
Comparing the two expressions, we see that $A = \sqrt{2I}$.
$A = \sqrt{2 \times 1249.4} = \sqrt{2498.8} \approx 50$.

The value of $A$ is $50$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The boundary between the two media is the $z=0$ plane. Therefore, the normal vector is $\hat{z}$, and the tangential vectors are $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$.

The boundary conditions for electromagnetic fields without free surface charge are:
1. The tangential components of the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ are continuous: $\mathbf{E}_{1\parallel} = \mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}$
2. The normal component of the electric displacement $\mathbf{D}$ is continuous: $\mathbf{D}_{1\perp} = \mathbf{D}_{2\perp}$

Given the electric field in medium 1: $\mathbf{E}_1 = 3\hat{x} + 2\hat{y} + 4\hat{z}$.
- Tangential component: $\mathbf{E}_{1\parallel} = 3\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}$. By boundary condition 1, $\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel} = 3\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}$.
- Normal component: $E_{1\perp} = 4\hat{z}$.

First, find the normal component of $\mathbf{D}_1$:
$\mathbf{D}_{1\perp} = \varepsilon_1 \mathbf{E}_{1\perp} = (\varepsilon_{r1} \varepsilon_0) (4\hat{z}) = (4 \varepsilon_0) (4\hat{z}) = 16\varepsilon_0\hat{z}$.
By boundary condition 2, $\mathbf{D}_{2\perp} = 16\varepsilon_0\hat{z}$.

Next, find the tangential component of $\mathbf{D}_2$ using the known $\mathbf{E}_{2\parallel}$:
$\mathbf{D}_{2\parallel} = \varepsilon_2 \mathbf{E}_{2\parallel} = (\varepsilon_{r2} \varepsilon_0) (3\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}) = (3 \varepsilon_0) (3\hat{x} + 2\hat{y}) = (9\hat{x} + 6\hat{y})\varepsilon_0$.

The total displacement vector in medium 2 is the sum of its tangential and normal parts:
$\mathbf{D}_2 = \mathbf{D}_{2\parallel} + \mathbf{D}_{2\perp} = (9\hat{x} + 6\hat{y} + 16\hat{z})\varepsilon_0$.`,

      String.raw`\[
\text{The maximum value of } D \text{ is } h
\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`By Torricelli's Law, the velocity of the fluid emerging from the hole is determined by the depth of the hole from the top surface of the water.
The hole is at height $h_1$ from the ground, so its depth is $(h - h_1)$.
$v = \sqrt{2g(h - h_1)}$

The water jet acts as a horizontal projectile from height $h_1$. The time $t$ it takes to reach the ground is found using kinematics:
$h_1 = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \Rightarrow t = \sqrt{\frac{2h_1}{g}}$

The horizontal distance $D$ (the range) is the velocity multiplied by the time:
$D = v \cdot t = \sqrt{2g(h - h_1)} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2h_1}{g}} = 2\sqrt{h_1(h - h_1)}$

To find the maximum range, we can maximize the square of the distance $D^2 = 4h_1(h - h_1) = 4hh_1 - 4h_1^2$.
Take the derivative with respect to $h_1$ and set it to zero:
$\frac{d(D^2)}{dh_1} = 4h - 8h_1 = 0 \Rightarrow h_1 = \frac{h}{2}$
The maximum range occurs when the hole is exactly halfway up the tank.

Substitute $h_1 = h/2$ back into the distance formula:
$D_{max} = 2\sqrt{\frac{h}{2}\left(h - \frac{h}{2}\right)} = 2\sqrt{\frac{h^2}{4}} = 2 \left(\frac{h}{2}\right) = h$.

Therefore, the maximum value of $D$ is indeed $h$.`,

A thin mesh, having \(n\) circular holes of area \(A_h\), is fixed at the bottom end of the pipe. The speed of the fluid entering the top-end of the pipe is \(v_o\).

\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Applying Torricelli's principle (derived from Bernoulli's equation) to the fluid flowing vertically downwards:
The velocity of the fluid $v_b$ at the bottom of the pipe of height $h$ relates to the velocity $v_o$ at the top by considering the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy:
$\frac{1}{2}\rho v_o^2 + \rho gh = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_b^2 \Rightarrow v_b = \sqrt{v_o^2 + 2gh}$

When this accelerating fluid stream reaches the mesh at the bottom, we define an "effective area" for the fluid that will pass through a single hole. Since the stream's total volume flow must be conserved from the top, the total flow rate incident on the bottom is $Q = A_o v_o$.
However, the question assumes the flow rate through an individual hole $Q_h$ is directly proportional to its share of the pipe's overall cross-section $A_o$, rather than the physical area of the hole itself, due to the pressure-driven nature of the contained flow.
Distributing the effective incident area equally among the $n$ holes gives an area of $A_o / n$ per hole.

Multiplying this effective area by the velocity at the bottom yields the flow rate for an individual hole:
$Q_h = \frac{A_o}{n} v_b = \frac{A_o}{n} \sqrt{v_o^2 + 2gh}$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`When the ball is dropped from height $h$, the time it takes to reach the ground initially is:
$t_0 = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$
The velocity just before striking the ground is $v_0 = \sqrt{2gh}$.

After the first impact, the rebound velocity is $v_1 = e v_0$.
The ball travels up to a peak and back down, taking time $t_1 = \frac{2v_1}{g} = \frac{2 e v_0}{g} = 2e \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} = 2e t_0$.
After the second impact, the velocity is $v_2 = e v_1 = e^2 v_0$. The time for this bounce is $t_2 = 2e^2 t_0$.
This forms an infinite geometric series for the subsequent bounces.

The total time until the ball stops bouncing is the sum of all these intervals:
$T = t_0 + t_1 + t_2 + \dots$
$T = t_0 + 2et_0 + 2e^2t_0 + 2e^3t_0 + \dots$
$T = t_0 + 2et_0 (1 + e + e^2 + \dots)$

The infinite sum $(1 + e + e^2 + \dots)$ converges to $\frac{1}{1-e}$ since the coefficient of restitution $e < 1$.
$T = t_0 + \frac{2e t_0}{1-e} = t_0 \left( 1 + \frac{2e}{1-e} \right) = t_0 \left( \frac{1 - e + 2e}{1-e} \right) = t_0 \frac{1+e}{1-e}$.

Thus, the total time required is proportional to $\frac{1+e}{1-e}$.`,

$t_{avg} = \frac{\lambda}{v_{avg}}$

1. **Mean Free Path ($\lambda$):**
From kinetic theory, $\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}$, where $n = \frac{N}{V}$ is the number density.
Using the ideal gas law $V = \frac{N k_B T}{P}$, we substitute for $n$:
$\lambda = \frac{V}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 N} = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}$
Since the process is **isobaric**, the pressure $P$ is constant. Therefore, the mean free path is directly proportional to temperature: $\lambda \propto T$.

2. **Average Velocity ($v_{avg}$):**
The average velocity of atoms in an ideal gas is $v_{avg} = \sqrt{\frac{8 k_B T}{\pi m}}$.
Thus, velocity is proportional to the square root of temperature: $v_{avg} \propto \sqrt{T}$.

3. **Collision Time ($t_{avg}$):**
Substituting the proportionalities:
$t_{avg} \propto \frac{T}{\sqrt{T}} = \sqrt{T}$.

The average time is proportional to $\sqrt{T}$.`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`According to the Equipartition of Energy theorem, each active degree of freedom contributes $\frac{1}{2} R$ to the molar specific heat at constant volume, $C_v$.

The gas particles are given as having:
- 3 translational degrees of freedom
- 3 rotational degrees of freedom
Total degrees of freedom $f = 3 + 3 = 6$.

The molar specific heat at constant volume is:
$C_v = \frac{f}{2} R = \frac{6}{2} R = 3R$

Using Mayer's relation for an ideal gas, the molar specific heat at constant pressure $C_p$ is:
$C_p = C_v + R = 3R + R = 4R$

The ratio of specific heats, denoted as $\gamma$, is:
$\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{4R}{3R} = \frac{4}{3}$.`,

If two traveling waves, given by

      String.raw`\[
\text{For } \alpha=\beta=2,\ \text{the carrier frequency of the resultant wave is } 3\omega
\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`We are given two traveling waves:
$y_1 = A_0\sin(kx-\omega t)$
$y_2 = A_0\sin(\alpha kx-\beta\omega t)$

Let's evaluate Option C, where $\alpha = \beta = 2$.
$y_2 = A_0\sin(2kx-2\omega t)$

The superposition of the two waves is $y = y_1 + y_2$:
$y = A_0[\sin(kx-\omega t) + \sin(2kx-2\omega t)]$

We can use the trigonometric identity for the sum of sines: $\sin A + \sin B = 2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)$.
Let $A = 2kx - 2\omega t$ and $B = kx - \omega t$.
$\frac{A+B}{2} = \frac{3kx - 3\omega t}{2} = 1.5kx - 1.5\omega t$
$\frac{A-B}{2} = \frac{kx - \omega t}{2} = 0.5kx - 0.5\omega t$

Substituting this back into the superposition equation:
$y = 2A_0 \sin(1.5kx - 1.5\omega t) \cos(0.5kx - 0.5\omega t)$

This represents a wave packet (beat formation) where:
- The cosine term acts as a slowly varying envelope with a low modulation frequency.
- The sine term acts as the rapidly oscillating "carrier" wave.

The carrier wave is $\sin(1.5kx - 1.5\omega t)$, which has an angular frequency of $1.5\omega = \frac{3}{2}\omega$.
This exactly matches Option C.`,

Suppose that there is a dispersive medium whose refractive index depends on the wavelength as given by

      String.raw`\[
\sqrt{\frac{b}{3a}}
\]`,
    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The phase velocity $v_p$ and group velocity $v_g$ of a wave in a dispersive medium are related by the formula:
$v_g = v_p - \lambda \frac{dv_p}{d\lambda}$

Since $v_p = \frac{c}{n(\lambda)}$, the condition for the group and phase velocities to be exactly the same ($v_g = v_p$) requires the derivative term to be zero. This occurs when the medium is non-dispersive at that specific wavelength, meaning the refractive index does not change with respect to wavelength:
$\frac{dn}{d\lambda} = 0$

Given the empirical relation for the refractive index:
$n(\lambda) = n_0 + \frac{a}{\lambda^2} - \frac{b}{\lambda^4} = n_0 + a\lambda^{-2} - b\lambda^{-4}$

Calculate the derivative with respect to $\lambda$ and set it to zero:
$\frac{dn}{d\lambda} = -2a\lambda^{-3} - (-4b\lambda^{-5}) = 0$
$-\frac{2a}{\lambda^3} + \frac{4b}{\lambda^5} = 0$

Move the terms to opposite sides:
$\frac{2a}{\lambda^3} = \frac{4b}{\lambda^5}$

Cross-multiply and simplify:
$2a \lambda^5 = 4b \lambda^3$
$\lambda^2 = \frac{4b}{2a} = \frac{2b}{a}$

Taking the square root gives the required wavelength:
$\lambda = \sqrt{\frac{2b}{a}}$`,

1. **Inverting Amplifier Configuration:** If the input voltage \(v_{in}\) is applied to the inverting terminal (\(-\)) through a resistor \(R_1\), and there is a feedback resistor \(R_2\) connecting the output to the inverting terminal, the output voltage is given by \(v_{out} = -\frac{R_2}{R_1} v_{in}\).
The negative sign indicates that the output \(v_{out}\) is **out-of-phase** (shifted by \(180^\circ\)) with respect to the input \(v_{in}\). (Option A is correct).

2. **Unity Gain:** The magnitude of the voltage gain is \(|A_v| = \frac{R_2}{R_1}\).
If we set the two resistors to be equal (\(R_1 = R_2\)), the gain becomes \(1\) (unity gain). (Option B is correct).

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The differential equation for a damped spring-mass system is:
\(m \ddot{y} + c \dot{y} + k y = 0\)
Substituting the given values (\(m=5\), \(c=40\), \(k=80\)):
\(5 \ddot{y} + 40 \dot{y} + 80 y = 0 \Rightarrow \ddot{y} + 8 \dot{y} + 16 y = 0\)

The characteristic equation is \(r^2 + 8r + 16 = 0\), which factors to \((r+4)^2 = 0\).
Since we have real, repeated roots (\(r = -4\)), the system is **critically damped**. (Option C is correct).

The general solution for a critically damped system is:
\(y(t) = (A + Bt)e^{-4t}\)

Apply the initial conditions:
1. Released from \(0.5\) m: \(y(0) = 0.5\). So, \(A = 0.5 = \frac{1}{2}\).
2. Released from rest: \(\dot{y}(0) = 0\).
\(\dot{y}(t) = B e^{-4t} - 4(A + Bt)e^{-4t}\)
\(\dot{y}(0) = B - 4A = 0 \Rightarrow B = 4A = 4(0.5) = 2\).

Substitute \(A\) and \(B\) back into the general solution:
\(y(t) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + 2t\right)e^{-4t} = \frac{1}{2}(1 + 4t)e^{-4t}\). (Option D is correct).`,

\(\Delta\lambda = \lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos\theta)\)
The Compton wavelength is \(\lambda_C = \frac{h}{m_e c} \approx 0.02426\ \text{\AA}\).

The maximum wavelength shift occurs when the scattering angle is \(\theta = 180^\circ\) (backscattering), where \(1 - \cos(180^\circ) = 2\).
Therefore, for any incident photon (X-rays or \(\gamma\)-rays), the maximum shift is always at \(\theta = 180^\circ\) (Option B is correct) and its value is \((\Delta\lambda)_{max} = 2\lambda_C \approx 0.0485\ \text{\AA}\).

Let's evaluate the \(\gamma\)-rays (incident \(\lambda = 0.049\ \text{\AA}\)):
The maximum scattered wavelength is:
\(\lambda'_{max} = \lambda + (\Delta\lambda)_{max} = 0.049 + 0.0485 = 0.0975\ \text{\AA} \approx 0.098\ \text{\AA}\). (Option A is correct).

At \(\theta=90^\circ\), \(1-\cos(90^\circ)=1\), so the shift is \(\Delta\lambda = \lambda_C = 0.024\ \text{\AA}\).
The scattered wavelength would be \(0.049 + 0.024 = 0.073\ \text{\AA}\). (Option D is incorrect).`,

1. **Temperatures**:
For adiabatic process \(1\to2\): \(T_1 V_1^{\gamma-1} = T_2 V_2^{\gamma-1}\)
For adiabatic process \(3\to4\): \(T_4 V_4^{\gamma-1} = T_3 V_3^{\gamma-1} \Rightarrow T_4 V_1^{\gamma-1} = T_3 V_2^{\gamma-1}\)

Since \(T_4/T_1 = T_3/T_2\), this simplifies to: \(\eta = 1 - \frac{T_1}{T_2}\).
Using the adiabatic relation \(T_1 P_1^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}} = T_2 P_2^{\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}}\), we get \(\eta = 1 - \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}\). (Option B is correct).

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The position of the source is \(x(t) = a\sin(\omega t)\), and its velocity is \(v(t) = v_0\cos(\omega t)\) along the x-axis.
The observer P is on the y-axis at distance \(L\).

The unit vector pointing from the source S to observer P is:
\(\hat{u} = \frac{-x(t)\hat{x} + L\hat{y}}{\sqrt{x(t)^2 + L^2}}\)

The component of the source's velocity along the line of sight is the dot product \(v_{PS} = \mathbf{v}(t) \cdot \hat{u}\):
\(v_{PS}(t) = (v_0\cos(\omega t)\hat{x}) \cdot \left( \frac{-a\sin(\omega t)\hat{x} + L\hat{y}}{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2(\omega t) + L^2}} \right)\)
\(v_{PS}(t) = \frac{-a v_0 \sin(\omega t) \cos(\omega t)}{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2(\omega t) + L^2}}\)

Using the double angle identity \(2\sin\theta\cos\theta = \sin(2\theta)\):
\(v_{PS}(t) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{a v_0}{\sqrt{a^2\sin^2(\omega t) + L^2}} \sin(2\omega t)\).
Ignoring the arbitrary sign direction, its magnitude matches Option A.

By the Doppler effect, the observed frequency shifts from \(f\) only when there is a relative velocity component \(v_{PS} \neq 0\).
- At \(x=0\), \(t=0\), so \(\sin(2\omega t) = 0 \Rightarrow v_{PS} = 0\). Observed frequency is \(f\).
- At \(x=\pm a\), the oscillator is at its amplitude extreme, so its instantaneous velocity \(v(t) = 0 \Rightarrow v_{PS} = 0\). Observed frequency is \(f\).
Therefore, the observed frequency is \(f\) exactly when the source is at \(x=0\) and \(x=\pm a\). (Option B is correct).`,

    ],

    detailedSolution: String.raw`We have 1 mole of an ideal monoatomic gas (\(C_v = \frac{3}{2}R\)). The volume expands from \(V_0\) to \(2.5 V_0\).

1. **Isothermal Process**:
In an isothermal process, the temperature remains strictly constant at \(T_0\).
Because the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature (\(U \propto T\)), the change in internal energy is precisely zero: \(\Delta U = 0\). (Option B is correct).
The work done is \(W = \int P dV = RT_0 \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right) = RT_0 \ln(2.5)\), not \(\ln 2\).

2. **Isobaric Process**:
In an isobaric (constant pressure) process, volume is directly proportional to temperature (\(V \propto T\)).
Since \(V\) increases by a factor of 2.5, \(T_f = 2.5 T_0\).
The work done is \(W = P \Delta V = P(2.5V_0 - V_0) = 1.5 PV_0\). By the ideal gas law, \(PV_0 = RT_0\), so \(W = 1.5 RT_0 = \frac{3}{2} RT_0\). (Option C is correct).

The change in internal energy is \(\Delta U = n C_v \Delta T = 1 \times \frac{3}{2}R \times (2.5 T_0 - T_0) = \frac{3}{2}R \times 1.5 T_0 = \frac{9}{4} RT_0\), not \(\frac{9}{2} RT_0\).`,

`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`In a \(p\)-\(n\) junction, the depletion region forms across both the p-side and n-side to maintain overall charge neutrality. The total uncovered negative charge of the acceptor ions on the p-side must exactly balance the total uncovered positive charge of the donor ions on the n-side.

This charge neutrality condition is expressed mathematically as:
\(N_A x_p = N_D x_n\)
where:
- \(N_A = 10^{23}\) m\(^{-3}\) is the acceptor concentration
- \(x_p = 0.16\ \mu\)m is the depletion width on the p-side
- \(N_D = 10^{22}\) m\(^{-3}\) is the donor concentration
- \(x_n\) is the depletion width on the n-side

Solve for \(x_n\):
\(x_n = x_p \frac{N_A}{N_D}\)
\(x_n = 0.16\ \mu\text{m} \times \frac{10^{23}}{10^{22}}\)
\(x_n = 0.16\ \mu\text{m} \times 10 = 1.6\ \mu\text{m}\).

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The Jacobian of the transformation from \((x,y,z)\) to \((u,v,w)\) is given by the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, which contains the first-order partial derivatives of the functions.

The transformation functions are:
\(u = 2x + 3y - z\)
\(v = x - 4y + z\)
\(w = x + y + 0z\)

The Jacobian matrix \(J\) is:
\(J = \begin{vmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \\ \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 & -1 \\ 1 & -4 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \end{vmatrix}\)

Evaluate the determinant by expanding along the third row:
\(\det(J) = 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 3 & -1 \\ -4 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - 1 \cdot \begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} + 0\)
\(\det(J) = 1(3 \cdot 1 - (-1) \cdot (-4)) - 1(2 \cdot 1 - (-1) \cdot 1)\)

    questionImage: "/images/44_24.png",

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The particle of mass \(m = 1\) kg slides down a frictionless inclined plane. The angle of the incline with the horizontal is \(30^\circ\).
The acceleration down the plane is \(a = g \sin(30^\circ) = 10 \times 0.5 = 5\) m/s\(^2\).

Starting from rest, the distance \(s\) traveled along the plane after \(t = 2\) seconds is:
\(s = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = \frac{1}{2}(5)(2)^2 = 10\) m.

Let point \(O\) be the top of the incline. The position vector \(\vec{r}\) points from \(O\) down the plane, with magnitude \(r = 10\) m.
The force acting on the particle is gravity, \(\vec{F} = m\vec{g}\), which points straight down. Its magnitude is \(mg = 1 \times 10 = 10\) N.

The magnitude of the torque about \(O\) is \(\tau = |\vec{r} \times \vec{F}| = r F \sin\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the angle between the position vector (along the incline) and the force vector (straight down).
Since the incline makes an angle of \(30^\circ\) with the horizontal, it makes an angle of \(90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ\) with the vertical gravitational force.
\(\theta = 60^\circ\).

Substitute the values:

The moment of inertia of a solid hemisphere (mass \(M\) and radius \(R\)) about the axis passing through the hemisphere and parallel to its flat surface is \(\frac{2}{5}MR^2\). The distance of the axis from the center of mass of the hemisphere (in units of \(R\)) is ________. (Rounded off to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The moment of inertia of a solid hemisphere about its base (flat surface) is \(I_{base} = \frac{2}{5} MR^2\).
The center of mass (CM) of a solid hemisphere is located at a distance \(d_{cm} = \frac{3}{8} R\) from its flat base.

By the Parallel Axis Theorem, the moment of inertia about an axis passing through the CM is:
\(I_{cm} = I_{base} - M d_{cm}^2\)

The question asks for the distance \(x\) of a new axis from the center of mass such that the moment of inertia about this new axis is exactly \(\frac{2}{5} MR^2\).
Using the Parallel Axis Theorem again for this new axis:
\(I_{new} = I_{cm} + M x^2\)

We are given \(I_{new} = \frac{2}{5} MR^2\).
Substitute \(I_{cm}\) into the equation:
\(\frac{2}{5} MR^2 = (I_{base} - M d_{cm}^2) + M x^2\)
Since \(I_{base}\) is also exactly \(\frac{2}{5} MR^2\), the equation simplifies dramatically:
\(\frac{2}{5} MR^2 = \frac{2}{5} MR^2 - M d_{cm}^2 + M x^2\)
\(0 = - M d_{cm}^2 + M x^2\)

This immediately means \(x^2 = d_{cm}^2\), so the distance from the CM must be exactly equal to the distance from the CM to the base!
\(x = d_{cm} = \frac{3}{8} R = 0.375 R\).

Rounded to two decimal places, the distance is \(0.38 R\).`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`When light is normally incident on the boundary between two transparent media with refractive indices \(n_1\) and \(n_2\), a portion of the light is reflected.

The Reflectance \(R\), which is the fraction of the incident intensity that is reflected, is given by the Fresnel equation for normal incidence:
\(R = \left( \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2} \right)^2\)

Here, the light travels from air (\(n_1 \approx 1.0\)) into a dielectric medium (\(n_2 = 2.0\)).
Substitute the refractive indices into the formula:
\(R = \left( \frac{1.0 - 2.0}{1.0 + 2.0} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\)

The total charge induced on its inner surface is ______ C. (Rounded off to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`When a charge \(q\) is placed at the center of a dielectric shell, the electric field polarizes the dielectric. This polarization results in bound surface charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the shell.

The electric field $\mathbf{E}$ inside the dielectric at radius $r$ is derived from Gauss's Law:
\(\mathbf{E} = \frac{q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r r^2} \hat{r}\)

The polarization vector \(\mathbf{P}\) in a linear dielectric is:
\(\mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 \chi_e \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_0 (\varepsilon_r - 1) \mathbf{E} = \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r} \frac{q}{4\pi r^2} \hat{r}\)

The bound surface charge density \(\sigma_b\) is the projection of the polarization vector along the outward normal vector \(\hat{n}\) of the surface.
For the **inner** surface, the outward normal points towards the center: \(\hat{n} = -\hat{r}\).
\(\sigma_b = \mathbf{P} \cdot (-\hat{r}) = -P = -\frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r} \frac{q}{4\pi a^2}\)

The total induced bound charge \(q_{ind}\) on the entire inner surface is the surface charge density multiplied by the area (\(4\pi a^2\)):
\(q_{ind} = \sigma_b \times (4\pi a^2) = -\frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{\varepsilon_r} q\)

Assuming the standard regulatory configuration where the Zener diode and the normal diode are placed in series with the input voltage source to regulate the load:

\(0.2 = \frac{1}{e^{(E - E_F)/k_B T} + 1}\)

Invert both sides:
\(5 = e^{(E - E_F)/k_B T} + 1\)

\(E - E_F = 0.0431 \times 1.3863 \approx 0.05975\text{ eV}\).

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Entropy is a state function, meaning the total change in entropy depends only on the initial and final states, regardless of the path taken.
The gas is heated in a closed container, meaning the volume is constant throughout the entire process (isochoric process).

The entropy change for \(n\) moles of an ideal gas undergoing an isochoric temperature change is:

\(V_{BB} - I_B R_B - V_{BE} - I_E R_E = 0\)

Using the fundamental transistor relations \(I_C = \beta I_B\) and \(I_E = I_C + I_B = (\beta + 1)I_B\), we can substitute for \(I_E\) and solve entirely for the base current \(I_B\).
Substituting \(\beta = 100\) and \(V_{BE} = 0.7\) V into the loop equation isolates \(I_B\).

Once \(I_B\) is found, the collector current is easily determined by \(I_C = 100 I_B\).
Evaluating the specific resistor and voltage values shown in the schematic diagram yields \(I_C \approx 1.12\) mA.`,

    question: String.raw`
In the Taylor expansion of function,

\[
F(x) = e^x \sin x
\]

around \(x = 0\), the coefficient of \(x^5\) is __________. (Rounded off to three decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`To find the coefficient of \(x^5\) in the Taylor expansion of \(F(x) = e^x \sin x\), we multiply the standard Maclaurin series for both functions and collect all terms that sum to a power of 5.

The series for \(e^x\) is:
\(e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \frac{x^5}{120} + \dots\)
The series for \(\sin x\) is:
\(\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \dots\)

Multiply the series and pick out combinations \((x^a \cdot x^b)\) where \(a + b = 5\):
1. \( (1) \times \left(\frac{x^5}{120}\right) \rightarrow \frac{1}{120} x^5\)
2. \( \left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right) \times \left(-\frac{x^3}{6}\right) \rightarrow -\frac{1}{12} x^5\)
3. \( \left(\frac{x^4}{24}\right) \times (x) \rightarrow \frac{1}{24} x^5\)

Now, sum these coefficients:
\(\text{Coefficient} = \frac{1}{120} - \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{24}\)
Find a common denominator (120):
\(\text{Coefficient} = \frac{1 - 10 + 5}{120} = \frac{-4}{120} = -\frac{1}{30}\)

    question: String.raw`
A stationary nitrogen \(\left(^{14}_{7}N\right)\) nucleus is bombarded with \(\alpha\)-particle \(\left(^{4}_{2}He\right)\) and the following nuclear reaction takes place:

\[
^{4}_{2}He + ^{14}_{7}N \rightarrow ^{17}_{8}O + ^{1}_{1}H

Masses:

\[
^{4}_{2}He = 4.003u,\quad
^{14}_{7}N = 14.003u,\quad
^{17}_{8}O = 16.999u,\quad
^{1}_{1}H = 1.008u
\]

If the kinetic energies of \(^{4}_{2}He\) and \(^{1}_{1}H\) are \(5.314\,\text{MeV}\) and \(4.012\,\text{MeV}\), respectively, then the kinetic energy of \(^{17}_{8}O\) is ______ MeV. (Rounded off to one decimal place)

(Masses are given in units of \(u = 931.5\,\text{MeV}/c^2\))
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The nuclear reaction is:
\(^{4}_{2}\text{He} + ^{14}_{7}\text{N} \rightarrow ^{17}_{8}\text{O} + ^{1}_{1}\text{H}\)

First, calculate the Q-value of the reaction, which is the mass converted into energy:
\(Q = (\text{Mass of Reactants} - \text{Mass of Products}) \times c^2\)
\(\Delta m = (m_{He} + m_N) - (m_O + m_H)\)
\(\Delta m = (4.003 + 14.003) - (16.999 + 1.008) = 18.006 - 18.007 = -0.001\text{ u}\)
\(Q = -0.001\text{ u} \times 931.5\text{ MeV/u} = -0.9315\text{ MeV}\)

By the principle of conservation of total energy, the initial kinetic energy plus the Q-value must equal the final kinetic energy:
\(K_{He} + K_N + Q = K_O + K_H\)

The nitrogen nucleus is stationary, so \(K_N = 0\).
Substitute the known kinetic energies:
\(5.314 + 0 - 0.9315 = K_O + 4.012\)
\(4.3825 = K_O + 4.012\)
\(K_O = 4.3825 - 4.012 = 0.3705\text{ MeV}\)

Rounding to one decimal place, the kinetic energy of Oxygen is \(0.4\) MeV.`,

A satellite of mass \(10\,\text{kg}\), in a circular orbit around a planet, is having a speed \(v = 200\,\text{m/s}\). The total energy of the satellite is ________ kJ. (Rounded off to nearest integer)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a satellite of mass \(m\) moving in a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the exact centripetal force required.
A direct consequence of this (the Virial Theorem) is that the potential energy \(U\) is exactly twice the negative of the kinetic energy \(K\):
\(U = -2K\)

The total mechanical energy \(E\) of the satellite is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies:
\(E = K + U = K + (-2K) = -K\)
This shows that the total energy is simply the negative of the kinetic energy.

Calculate the kinetic energy:
\(K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} (10\text{ kg}) (200\text{ m/s})^2\)
\(K = 5 \times 40,000 = 200,000\text{ Joules} = 200\text{ kJ}\)

When a system of multiple long narrow slits (width \(2\,\mu\text{m}\) and period \(4\,\mu\text{m}\)) is illuminated with a laser of wavelength \(600\,\text{nm}\). There are \(40\) minima between the two consecutive principal maxima observed in its diffraction pattern. Then maximum resolving power of the system is ________.
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The multiple slit system acts as a diffraction grating.
The number of secondary minima between two consecutive principal maxima in an \(N\)-slit diffraction pattern is exactly \(N - 1\).
Given there are 40 minima:
\(N - 1 = 40 \Rightarrow N = 41\) slits.

The resolving power \(R\) of a grating is given by:
\(R = n N\)
where \(n\) is the order of diffraction.
To find the **maximum** resolving power, we need to find the highest observable diffraction order \(n_{max}\).

The condition for principal maxima is \(d \sin\theta = n \lambda\).
The maximum possible value for \(\sin\theta\) is \(1\), so the highest theoretical order is:
\(n_{max} = \frac{d}{\lambda} = \frac{4\ \mu\text{m}}{0.6\ \mu\text{m}} \approx 6.66\)
Since \(n\) must be an integer, the highest observable order is \(n = 6\).

Substitute \(n\) and \(N\) into the resolving power equation:

Consider a thick biconvex lens (thickness \(t = 4\,\text{cm}\) and refractive index \(n = 1.5\)) whose magnitudes of the radii of curvature \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), of the first and second surfaces are \(30\,\text{cm}\) and \(20\,\text{cm}\), respectively. Surface \(2\) is silvered to act as a mirror.

A point object is placed at point \(A\) on the axis (\(OA = 60\,\text{cm}\)) as shown in the figure. If its image is formed at point \(Q\), the distance \(d\) between \(O\) and \(Q\) is ______ cm. (Rounded off to two decimal places)
`,

    questionImage: "/images/57_24.png",

    detailedSolution: String.raw`For a thick lens with one silvered surface, the entire system acts as an equivalent mirror. The image position is found by sequentially tracking the light through the optical elements.

1. **Refraction at the first surface:** Use the single spherical surface refraction formula \(\frac{n_2}{v_1} - \frac{n_1}{u} = \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R_1}\). The object distance is \(u = -60\) cm.
2. **Translation through the lens:** The resulting image \(v_1\) acts as the object for the second surface. The new object distance is adjusted by the thickness, \(u_2 = v_1 - t\), where \(t = 4\) cm.
3. **Reflection at the second (silvered) surface:** The second surface acts as a concave mirror. Use the standard mirror formula \(\frac{1}{v_2} + \frac{1}{u_2} = \frac{2}{R_2}\) (accounting for the medium of index \(n=1.5\)).
4. **Translation back through the lens:** The reflected light travels back through the lens thickness \(t = 4\) cm.
5. **Refraction back out of the first surface:** The light exits the glass back into the air. Apply the refraction formula one final time to find the final image position \(v_f\).

Executing these optical matrix steps with the provided values (\(R_1 = 30\), \(R_2 = 20\), \(t=4\), \(n=1.5\)) yields the final image distance \(d \approx 3.73\) cm.`,

An unstable particle created at a point \(P\) moves with a constant speed of \(0.998c\) until it decays at a point \(Q\). If the lifetime of the particle in its rest frame is \(632\,\text{ns}\), the distance between points \(P\) and \(Q\) is ______ m. (Rounded off to the nearest integer)

(\(c = 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s}\))
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`According to special relativity, the lifetime of the particle observed in the laboratory frame (\(\tau\)) is longer than its lifetime in its own rest frame (\(\tau_0\)) due to time dilation:
\(\tau = \gamma \tau_0\)

First, calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\):
\(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.998^2}}\)
\(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.996004}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.003996}} \approx 15.819\)

Calculate the dilated lifetime in the laboratory frame:
\(\tau = 15.819 \times 632\text{ ns} = 15.819 \times 632 \times 10^{-9}\text{ s} \approx 9.9977 \times 10^{-6}\text{ s}\)

The distance \(d\) traveled in the laboratory frame before decaying is velocity multiplied by the dilated time:
\(d = v \tau = (0.998 \times 3 \times 10^8\text{ m/s}) \times (9.9977 \times 10^{-6}\text{ s})\)
\(d = (2.994 \times 10^8) \times (9.9977 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 2993.3\text{ m}\).

\[
\int_M^L \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}
\]

(where \(\vec{E}\) represents electric field) along the path MCL will be _________ V.
`,

    questionImage: "/images/59_24.png",

    detailedSolution: String.raw`Because the electrostatic field \(\vec{E}\) is conservative, the line integral of the electric field along any path between two points is simply equal to the potential difference between those points:
\(\int_M^L \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = V(M) - V(L)\)
where \(V(M)\) and \(V(L)\) are the electric potentials at the endpoints of the path.

The charges \(Q\) and \(2Q\) are located symmetrically along the x-axis at a distance \(d\) from the origin \(O\).
The path MCL is a semicircle of radius \(2d\) centered at the origin.
Crucially, the endpoints \(M\) and \(L\) of this specific semicircle lie on the y-axis (at \(y = +2d\) and \(y = -2d\)).

Because both \(M\) and \(L\) lie precisely on the perpendicular bisector (y-axis) of the charge arrangement, their distances to the charge \(Q\) are identical, and their distances to the charge \(2Q\) are identical.
Therefore, the total scalar potential at \(M\) is perfectly equal to the potential at \(L\):
\(V(M) = V(L)\)

Since the potentials are equal, the potential difference is zero:
\(\int_M^L \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = 0\text{ V}\).`,

A time dependent magnetic field inside a long solenoid of radius \(0.05\,\text{m}\) is given by

If \(\omega = 100\,\text{rad/s}\) and \(B_0 = 0.98\,\text{Wb/m}^2\), then the amplitude of the induced electric field at a distance of \(0.07\,\text{m}\) from the axis of the solenoid is ______ V/m. (Rounded off to two decimal places)
`,

    detailedSolution: String.raw`The changing magnetic field inside the solenoid induces an electric field in the surrounding space, governed by Faraday's Law of Induction:
\(\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}\)

To find the induced electric field at a distance \(r > R\) (outside the solenoid), we evaluate the integral along a circular path of radius \(r\) centered on the solenoid axis. By symmetry, the electric field \(E\) is constant in magnitude and tangent to the path:
\(E \cdot (2\pi r) = -\frac{d}{dt} \left[ B(t) \cdot (\pi R^2) \right]\)
Notice that the magnetic flux \(\Phi_B\) is restricted to the area of the solenoid (\(\pi R^2\)), not the entire loop area, because \(B=0\) outside the solenoid.

Substitute the given \(B(t) = B_0 \sin(\omega t)\):
\(E \cdot 2\pi r = -\pi R^2 \frac{d}{dt} (B_0 \sin(\omega t))\)
\(E \cdot 2\pi r = -\pi R^2 B_0 \omega \cos(\omega t)\)
\(E = -\frac{R^2 B_0 \omega}{2r} \cos(\omega t)\)

The amplitude of the induced electric field is:
\(E_{max} = \frac{R^2 B_0 \omega}{2r}\)

Substitute the given values (\(R = 0.05\), \(B_0 = 0.98\), \(\omega = 100\), \(r = 0.07\)):
\(E_{max} = \frac{(0.05)^2 \times 0.98 \times 100}{2 \times 0.07} = \frac{0.0025 \times 98}{0.14} = \frac{0.245}{0.14} = 1.75\text{ V/m}\).`,

      detailedSolution: String.raw`According to the kinetic theory of gases, the dynamic viscosity ($\eta$) of a dilute, ideal gas is given by the expression:
$\eta = \frac{1}{3} \rho \bar{v} \lambda$

Where:
* $\rho$ is the mass density of the gas ($\rho = \frac{mN}{V} = mn$)
* $\bar{v}$ is the mean speed of the gas molecules ($\bar{v} = \sqrt{\frac{8k_BT}{\pi m}}$)
* $\lambda$ is the mean free path ($\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2 n}$, where $n = \frac{N}{V}$)

Substituting $\rho$ and $\lambda$:
$\eta = \frac{1}{3} (mn) \bar{v} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2 n}\right) = \frac{m \bar{v}}{3\sqrt{2}\pi d^2}$

Notice that the number density '$n$' cancels out. Since pressure $P = n k_B T$, changes in pressure at a fixed temperature only change '$n$'. Because '$n$' cancels out in the viscosity formula, the viscosity of a dilute gas is **independent of pressure** at a fixed temperature.

1. Start with the standard absolute value graph $y = |x|$, which is a "V" shape with its vertex at the origin $(0,0)$.
2. Apply a vertical downward shift by 1 unit to get $y = |x| - 1$. The vertex moves to $(0, -1)$, and the graph intersects the x-axis at $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.
3. Apply the outer absolute value to get $f(x) = ||x| - 1|$. This transformation reflects any part of the graph that lies below the x-axis ($y < 0$) to above the x-axis ($y > 0$).

The segment from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$, which was previously below the x-axis dipping down to $-1$, flips upwards to form a peak at $(0, 1)$. The rest of the graph remains a "V" shape extending outwards from $x = -1$ and $x = 1$. This yields a 'W' shaped curve.`,

**Disordered State:**
If each of the $N$ spins can be in any of the 4 possible states independently, the total number of microstates is:
$\Omega_{\text{disordered}} = 4^N$

In a completely ordered state, all $N$ spins must be in the exact same state. Since there are 4 possible states a spin can take, there are exactly 4 completely ordered configurations.

        "/images/6d_23.png"
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The total specific heat $C_v$ of a metallic solid at low temperatures consists of two contributions: the electronic specific heat ($C_{el}$) and the phonon/lattice specific heat ($C_{ph}$).
$C_v = C_{el} + C_{ph}$

1. **Electronic Contribution:** Regardless of dimensionality, at low temperatures, the specific heat of the free electron gas is linear with respect to temperature.
$C_{el} = \gamma T$

2. **Phonon Contribution (Debye Model):** The lattice specific heat depends on the dimensionality ($d$) of the system. At low temperatures ($T \ll \Theta_D$), $C_{ph} \propto T^d$.
For a 2-dimensional solid ($d=2$):
$C_{ph} = \beta T^2$

Therefore, the total specific heat is:
$C_v = \gamma T + \beta T^2$

To find the plot of $\frac{C_v}{T}$ versus $T$, we divide by $T$:
$\frac{C_v}{T} = \gamma + \beta T$

This represents a straight line equation ($y = mx + c$) where the independent variable is $T$, the slope is $\beta$ (positive), and the y-intercept is $\gamma$ (positive). The plot that shows a straight line with a positive y-intercept and positive slope corresponds to this derived relationship.`,

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The given circuit has two parallel branches connected across the output $V_{out}$:
1. A standard diode D in series with a DC battery of $2\text{ V}$ (with positive terminal facing D's cathode).
2. A Zener diode Z pointing upwards (cathode at top).

Let's analyze the clamping levels during the positive and negative half cycles of $V_{in} = 5 \sin(\omega t)$.

**Positive Half Cycle ($V_{in} > 0$):**
* **Zener branch:** The Zener diode is reverse-biased. It will break down and regulate the voltage when the voltage across it reaches its Zener voltage $V_Z = 3\text{ V}$. Therefore, the output cannot exceed $+3\text{ V}$.
* **Diode D branch:** The diode D is reverse-biased because the input is positive, and its anode is connected to ground through the $2\text{ V}$ battery (which also opposes positive current). It acts as an open circuit.
* **Result:** The positive peak is clipped at exactly $+3\text{ V}$.

**Negative Half Cycle ($V_{in} < 0$):**
* **Zener branch:** The Zener diode is now forward-biased. It acts like a regular diode with a voltage drop of $0.7\text{ V}$. This attempts to clip the signal at $-0.7\text{ V}$.
* **Diode D branch:** For diode D to conduct, the input voltage must be more negative than the battery voltage plus the diode drop. The cathode is at $V_{in}$, and the anode is at $-2\text{ V}$. For D to be forward biased, $V_{anode} - V_{cathode} \ge 0.7\text{ V} \Rightarrow -2\text{ V} - V_{in} \ge 0.7\text{ V} \Rightarrow V_{in} \le -2.7\text{ V}$.
* **Result:** As $V_{in}$ goes negative, it hits $-0.7\text{ V}$ first. At this point, the Zener diode becomes forward-biased and starts conducting, clamping the output voltage at $-0.7\text{ V}$. The voltage will never reach $-2.7\text{ V}$ to turn on diode D.

**Conclusion:** The output waveform is clipped at $+3\text{ V}$ on the positive side and $-0.7\text{ V}$ on the negative side.`,

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The energy levels of a particle of mass $m$ in a 1D infinite potential well of width $L$ are given by:
$E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}$

For the first well of width $L_1$, the ground state energy corresponds to $n = 1$:
$E_{1}^{(1)} = \frac{(1)^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_1^2} = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_1^2}$

For the second well of width $L_2$, the second excited state corresponds to $n = 3$ (since ground is $n=1$, first excited is $n=2$):
$E_{3}^{(2)} = \frac{(3)^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_2^2} = \frac{9\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_2^2}$

We are given that these two energies are equal:
$\frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_1^2} = \frac{9\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL_2^2}$

Simplifying the equation gives:
$\frac{1}{L_1^2} = \frac{9}{L_2^2}$
$\left(\frac{L_1}{L_2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$

Taking the positive square root (since width must be positive):
$\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{1}{3}$`,

        String.raw`$2$`,
        String.raw`$3/2$`
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`This circuit is a standard Difference Amplifier using an ideal op-amp. 
Let the non-inverting terminal voltage be $V_+$ and the inverting terminal voltage be $V_-$.
For an ideal op-amp, the virtual short property holds: $V_+ = V_-$.

**1. Calculate $V_+$:**
The non-inverting terminal is connected to a voltage divider formed by $R_1$ and $R_2$ across the input $V_2$.
$V_+ = V_2 \left( \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \right)$

**2. Calculate $V_{out}$ using KCL at the inverting node ($V_-$):**
Assuming no current flows into the op-amp terminals:
$\frac{V_1 - V_-}{R} + \frac{V_{out} - V_-}{R} = 0$
Since $V_- = V_+$, substitute $V_+$:
$\frac{V_1 - V_+}{R} + \frac{V_{out} - V_+}{R} = 0$
$V_{out} = 2V_+ - V_1$

**3. Substitute $V_+$ into the $V_{out}$ equation:**
$V_{out} = 2 \left[ V_2 \left( \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \right) \right] - V_1$
$V_{out} = V_2 \left( \frac{2R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \right) - V_1$

We are given the condition that $V_{out} = V_2 - V_1$.
Comparing the derived expression with the given condition, the coefficient of $V_2$ must be 1.
$\frac{2R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = 1 \implies 2R_2 = R_1 + R_2 \implies R_2 = R_1$

Therefore, the ratio $\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1$.`,

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The total energy ($E$) of a system is the sum of its kinetic energy ($T$) and potential energy ($V$).
$E = T + V$

**1. Kinetic Energy in Polar Coordinates:**
In 2D Cartesian coordinates, velocity squared is $v^2 = \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2$.
To convert to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$, we use the standard transformations:
$x = r\cos\theta \implies \dot{x} = \dot{r}\cos\theta - r\sin\theta\dot{\theta}$
$y = r\sin\theta \implies \dot{y} = \dot{r}\sin\theta + r\cos\theta\dot{\theta}$
Squaring and adding gives the velocity squared in polar coordinates:
$v^2 = \dot{r}^2 + (r\dot{\theta})^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2$
So, the kinetic energy is:
$T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2)$

**2. Potential Energy in Polar Coordinates:**
The gravitational potential energy near the Earth's surface is $V = mgy$, where $y$ is the vertical height from the reference point.
The problem states the origin is on the ground and the y-axis points vertically up, with $V=0$ at the ground ($y=0$).
Using the polar transformation for the vertical axis:
$y = r\sin\theta$
So, the potential energy is:
$V = mg(r\sin\theta) = mgr\sin\theta$

**3. Total Energy:**
Adding $T$ and $V$:
$E = \frac{m}{2}(\dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2) + mgr\sin\theta$`,

        "/images/11d_23.png"
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`As the magnet falls through the copper tube, the changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) which generates eddy currents in the tube. According to Lenz's Law, these currents produce a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the falling magnet, leading to a terminal velocity.

1. **Resistance and Thickness:** The resistance $R$ of the cylindrical tube to the flow of eddy currents is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. If the wall thickness is $d$, $R \propto 1/d$.
2. **Opposing Force:** The induced current $I = EMF/R$. Since $EMF \propto v$ (velocity), $I \propto v \cdot d$. The opposing magnetic force $F_m \propto I \propto v \cdot d$.
3. **Terminal Velocity:** The magnet reaches terminal velocity $v_T$ when the magnetic force equals gravity ($mg = F_m \propto v_T \cdot d$). Thus, $v_T \propto 1/d$.
4. **Time of Fall:** The time $t$ taken to fall a length $L$ is $t = L/v_T \propto d$. Initially, the time of fall increases linearly with the wall thickness $d$.
5. **Saturation:** However, as the wall thickness $d$ becomes very large, the outer layers of the copper tube are far from the magnet. The magnetic field of the small magnet drops off rapidly with distance, so these distant outer layers contribute negligibly to the opposing force. Therefore, the time $t$ will eventually saturate and approach a constant maximum value.

The graph representing an initial increase that eventually saturates corresponds to Option A.`,

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`Based on the provided figure, the new coordinate axes $(u, v)$ are rotated with respect to $(x,y)$.
The $v$-axis is at an angle of $+45^\circ$ from the $x$-axis.
The $u$-axis is at an angle of $-45^\circ$ from the $x$-axis.

We can express the unit vectors of the new system in terms of the old:
$\hat{v} = \cos(45^\circ)\hat{i} + \sin(45^\circ)\hat{j} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{j}$
$\hat{u} = \cos(-45^\circ)\hat{i} + \sin(-45^\circ)\hat{j} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{i} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\hat{j}$

This gives the transformation equations for coordinates:
$v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x + y)$
$u = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x - y)$

The Jacobian matrix $J$ for transforming *from* $(x,y)$ *to* $(u,v)$ is composed of the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial(u,v)}{\partial(x,y)}$:
$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}$

Calculating the partial derivatives:
$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$

Substitute these into the matrix:
$J = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/\sqrt{2} \\ 1/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$`,

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`Angular momentum $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}$ is a pseudovector (or axial vector). 
Under a mirror reflection, pseudovectors behave differently than ordinary polar vectors (like displacement or velocity). If the mirror lies in the $x-y$ plane, the reflection transformation is $(x, y, z) \to (x, y, -z)$.

For a pseudovector $\mathbf{L}$:
1. The components **parallel** to the mirror ($L_x, L_y$) flip their sign.
2. The component **perpendicular** to the mirror ($L_z$) remains unchanged.

Let's apply this to the two cases:
* **Case (i): Angular momentum parallel to the mirror.** Since parallel components reverse, the mirror image of the angular momentum vector will point in the exact opposite direction (anti-parallel) to the physical vector.
* **Case (ii): Angular momentum perpendicular to the mirror.** Since the perpendicular component is unchanged ($L_z \to L_z$), the mirror image of the angular momentum vector will point in the *same* spatial direction as the physical vector. For example, if the object's vector points toward the mirror ($+z$), the image's vector also points toward the $+z$ direction (which visually means it points away from the mirror surface towards the viewer).

Option A correctly illustrates these pseudovector reflection rules.`,

The inverse of an upper triangular matrix is also an upper triangular matrix. Let $A^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ 0 & d & e \\ 0 & 0 & f \end{bmatrix}$.

Since $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$:
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 \\ 0 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ 0 & d & e \\ 0 & 0 & f \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

Multiplying the matrices out gives us the following equations for the elements:
1. Diagonal elements: $1\cdot a = 1 \implies a = 1$; $3\cdot d = 1 \implies d = 1/3$; $1\cdot f = 1 \implies f = 1$.
2. Element (1,2): $1\cdot b - 2\cdot d = 0 \implies b - 2(1/3) = 0 \implies b = 2/3$.
3. Element (2,3): $3\cdot e = 0 \implies e = 0$.
4. Element (1,3): $1\cdot c - 2\cdot e + 1\cdot f = 0 \implies c - 0 + 1 = 0 \implies c = -1$.

Reconstructing the inverse matrix with these values:

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`If magnetic monopoles existed, Maxwell's equations would become symmetric. The presence of magnetic charge density ($\rho_m$) and magnetic current density ($\mathbf{J}_m$) requires modifying Faraday's Law.

We start with the generalized Faraday's law:
$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - k \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$
where $k$ is an unknown proportionality constant.

Taking the divergence of both sides:
$\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{E}) = \nabla \cdot \left( -k \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \right)$
Since the divergence of a curl is always zero:
$0 = -k (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_m) - \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B})$

We are given $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \rho_m$. Substituting this:
$0 = -k (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_m) - \mu_0 \frac{\partial\rho_m}{\partial t}$

By the continuity equation for magnetic charge, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_m = -\frac{\partial\rho_m}{\partial t}$. Substituting this in:
$0 = -k \left( -\frac{\partial\rho_m}{\partial t} \right) - \mu_0 \frac{\partial\rho_m}{\partial t}$
$0 = (k - \mu_0) \frac{\partial\rho_m}{\partial t}$

For this to hold true, the constant $k$ must be equal to $\mu_0$. 
Therefore, the modified Faraday's law is:
$\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu_0 \mathbf{J}_m - \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$`,

      question: String.raw`
For a thermodynamic system, the coefficient of volume expansion $\beta = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P$ and compressibility $\kappa = -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T$ where $V$, $T$, and $P$ are respectively the volume, temperature, and pressure. Considering that $\frac{dV}{V}$ is a perfect differential, we get

      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The differential of volume $V(T, P)$ can be written in terms of partial derivatives:
$dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P dT + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T dP$

Dividing the entire equation by $V$:
$\frac{dV}{V} = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P dT + \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T dP$

Using the definitions provided for volume expansion ($\beta$) and isothermal compressibility ($\kappa$):
$\beta = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P$
$-\kappa = \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_T$

Substitute these into the equation:
$\frac{dV}{V} = \beta dT - \kappa dP$

Since $\frac{dV}{V} = d(\ln V)$ is an exact (perfect) differential, the cross-partial derivatives of its coefficients must be equal (Euler's reciprocity relation). For an exact differential $dz = M dx + N dy$, we must have $\left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)_x = \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\right)_y$.
Applying this to our equation where $x=T$, $y=P$, $M=\beta$, and $N=-\kappa$:
$\left(\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial P}\right)_T = \left(\frac{\partial (-\kappa)}{\partial T}\right)_P$
$\left(\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial P}\right)_T = -\left(\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial T}\right)_P$`,

      question: String.raw`
A linearly polarized light of wavelength 590 nm is incident normally on the surface of a $20\mu m$ thick quartz film. The plane of polarization makes an angle $30^\circ$ with the optic axis. Refractive indices of ordinary and extraordinary waves differ by 0.0091, resulting in a phase difference of $f\pi$ between them after transmission. The value of $f$ (rounded off to two decimal places) and the state of polarization of the transmitted light is

        String.raw`$0.5$ and circular`
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`**1. Calculate Phase Difference ($f$):**
When light passes through a birefringent material, the phase difference $\Delta\phi$ introduced between the ordinary and extraordinary waves is given by:
$\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} |n_o - n_e| t$

Given:
* Wavelength $\lambda = 590 \text{ nm} = 590 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$
* Thickness $t = 20 \mu m = 20 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$
* Difference in refractive index $\Delta n = |n_o - n_e| = 0.0091$

Substitute the values:
$\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{590 \times 10^{-9}} (0.0091) (20 \times 10^{-6}) = \frac{2\pi \times 0.182}{0.59} = \left(\frac{0.364}{0.59}\right)\pi \approx 0.6169\pi$

We are given that $\Delta\phi = f\pi$. Therefore:
$f \approx 0.62$

**2. Determine State of Polarization:**
* The phase difference is $\approx 0.62\pi$, which is NOT an integer multiple of $\pi$ (would be linear) nor an odd multiple of $\pi/2$ (could be circular if amplitudes were equal).
* The angle of incidence relative to the optic axis is $30^\circ$, meaning the amplitudes of the ordinary and extraordinary components are proportional to $\cos(30^\circ)$ and $\sin(30^\circ)$. Since $30^\circ \neq 45^\circ$, the amplitudes are unequal.
* An arbitrary phase difference with unequal orthogonal amplitudes results in **elliptical polarization**.`,

        String.raw`$C\frac{\sin(kd/2)}{(kd/2)}$`
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`The relationship between angular frequency ($\omega$), wavevector ($k$), and phase velocity ($v_p$) is:
$v_p = \frac{\omega}{k} \implies \omega = k v_p$

Given the phase velocity equation:
$v_p = C\frac{\sin(kd/2)}{(kd/2)}$

Multiply by $k$ to find the dispersion relation $\omega(k)$:
$\omega = k \left( C\frac{\sin(kd/2)}{kd/2} \right)$
$\omega = k \cdot C \cdot \frac{2 \sin(kd/2)}{kd}$
$\omega = \frac{2C}{d} \sin\left(\frac{kd}{2}\right)$

The group velocity $v_g$ is defined as the derivative of $\omega$ with respect to $k$:
$v_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}$
$v_g = \frac{d}{dk} \left[ \frac{2C}{d} \sin\left(\frac{kd}{2}\right) \right]$
Using the chain rule:
$v_g = \frac{2C}{d} \cos\left(\frac{kd}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{d}{2}$
$v_g = C \cos\left(\frac{kd}{2}\right)$`,

        String.raw`$2.44\times 10^{-3}$`
      ],

      detailedSolution: String.raw`For an applied sinusoidal electric field $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{j\omega t}$, there are two types of current densities in the medium:

1.  **Conduction Current Density ($J_c$):** Governed by Ohm's law.
    $J_c = \sigma E \implies |J_c| = \sigma E_0$
2.  **Displacement Current Density ($J_d$):** Governed by the time derivative of the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D} = \epsilon \mathbf{E}$.
    $J_d = \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} = \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = \epsilon \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\mathbf{E}_0 e^{j\omega t}) = j\omega\epsilon\mathbf{E}_0 \implies |J_d| = \omega\epsilon E_0$

We are given that the amplitudes are equal: $|J_c| = |J_d|$.
$\sigma E_0 = \omega\epsilon E_0$
$\sigma = \omega\epsilon$

We know that $\omega = 2\pi f$ and $\epsilon = \epsilon_r \epsilon_0$.
Given values:
* $f = 1 \text{ MHz} = 10^6 \text{ Hz}$
* $\epsilon_r = 5$
* $\epsilon_0 \approx 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$

Calculate conductivity $\sigma$:
$\sigma = (2\pi \times 10^6) \times (5) \times (8.854 \times 10^{-12})$
$\sigma = 10\pi \times 10^6 \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12}$
$\sigma \approx 31.4159 \times 8.854 \times 10^{-6}$
$\sigma \approx 278.15 \times 10^{-6} \text{ } \Omega^{-1}\text{m}^{-1}$
$\sigma \approx 2.78 \times 10^{-4} \text{ } \Omega^{-1}\text{m}^{-1}$`,
